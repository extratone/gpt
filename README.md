# Gee Pee Tee

## This repository contains records of my conversations with OpenAI's silly text generation robot in multiple file formats. 

If you're more curious about the content of the conversations themselves, check out [the HTML index on my TildeTown](https://tilde.town/~/extratone/gpt). (An unindexed mirror is maintained here via GitHub Pages.)

*As of right now, these are exclusively sourced from conversations with the free, third(?) version available at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com).*

## Methodology

I used [@pionxzsh's ChatGPTExporter Userscript](https://github.com/pionxzh/chatgpt-exporter) running in @quoid's [Userscripts Safari Extension](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) to export the history of my chats in all available formats. My configuration is depicted in the screenshot embedded below.
