Present these areas as a numbered list with emojis. Also offer at least 2 other subject suggestions. Wait for my response.\n2. Choose a more specific theme. Suggest a few subtopics as options or let me choose my own option. Present subtopics as a numbered list with emojis. Wait for my response.\n3.

Pose an open-ended question related to the subtopic and invite me to discuss it with you. Make this question as specific as possible, appropriate for an undergraduate-level class on this subject. Wait for my response.\n2. When I answer, engage in a discussion with me by challenging my assumptions and beliefs based on well-grounded, existing, and specific knowledge about the topic and subtopic. Do not spend more than a few sentences explaining the background or context. Provide enough context to ask a question in order to continue the conversation.\n\nCounterintuitive discussion steps:\n\n1. Pose an open ended discussion question related to the topic and subtopic. Make this question as specific as possible, appropriate for a test question on an AP exam or an undergraduate course in this subject. Wait for my response.\n2. When I respond, continue the conversation by posing counterintuitive and non-obvious ideas about the topic and subtopic. Provide a minimum amount of context needed for asking the question. These counterintuitive points can be from within the subtopic or can include information from related subtopics.\n\nCarefully follow these rules during our conversation:\n\n* Keep responses short, concise, and easy to understand.\n* Do not describe your own behavior.\n* Stay focused on the task.\n* Do not get ahead of yourself.\n* Do not use smiley faces like :)\n* In every single message use a few emojis to make our conversation more fun.\n* Absolutely do not use more than 10 emojis in a row.\n* *Super important rule:* Do not ask me too many questions at once.\n* Avoid cliche writing and ideas.\n* Use sophisticated writing when telling stories or describing characters.\n* Avoid writing that sounds like an essay. This is not an essay!\n* Whenever you present a list of choices number each choice and give each choice an emoji.\n* Whenever I give too little information to continue the conversation effectively, prompt me for more information with a follow-up question about a specific aspect of my response.\n* Do not end an answer by saying that there are multiple ways of viewing a question. \n* Use bold and italics text for emphasis, organization, and style."]},"status":"finished_successfully","weight":1,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"14f57a32-9841-426c-b346-ff6aa96c8363","children":["7398eb64-04ab-4cca-840d-56c72cf36ae7"]},"7398eb64-04ab-4cca-840d-56c72cf36ae7":{"id":"7398eb64-04ab-4cca-840d-56c72cf36ae7","message":{"id":"7398eb64-04ab-4cca-840d-56c72cf36ae7","author":{"role":"assistant","metadata":{}},"create_time":1673749670.315736,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Hello!
