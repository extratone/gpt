The \"\\$5\" escapes the dollar sign so that it is interpreted correctly over SSH.\n- `tr -d '%'`: This command removes the percent sign from the output, so that only the numerical value is left.\n- `| widget`: This command pipes the output of the previous commands to the \"widget\" command.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace \"widget\" with the actual name or path of the command you want to pipe the output to."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop":"<|im_end|>"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"1ff20dbf-c006-4f63-bf5a-71fc957827df","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"e8bd9dd9-f8af-4fb7-bf65-54d44367f768","conversation_id":"5e4f7a34-4e00-4cbe-b2e9-e1bda678921e"}
