Indeed, I have covered thousands and thousands of miles - mostly throughout my home state, Missouri - since first acquiring my license some 15 years ago. Though I was making less than $8 an hour at a tool store, I spent virtually all of it on what little fuel my NB Miata consumed across 15,000 of these in just our first summer together. I was 19 and - though I thought I'd been exposed to a great breadth of car culture - I did not realize just how much of it has absolutely nothing to do with actually driving.\n\nThere are plenty of very good reasons for this, of course - depreciation, danger, etc. - but in the decade since I'd owned that car[1], I've nursed a hypothesis that feels more original than I'd like it to: I'm not sure local \"fast boys\" actually know where to go to enjoy their automobiles. Having just gotten back on the road for the first time in several years, this notion has become especially poignant thanks to frequent observations made in just the past eight or nine weeks. I've seen far too much fast boy behavior in completely inappropriate locales. (Full-throttle Hellcat acceleration downtown on a busy weekend evening, for instance.)\n\nHowever, in tandem with these, I have also observed - having returned to the routes I would have once been able to prescribe more or less verbally in place of these contexts - that all have become more risk-intensive settings in which to drive quickly. Route K between The Big Burr Oak and Rock Bridge High School - where I once spent my gas station lunch breaks shuffling my dear, departed XJR (https://www.instagram.com/p/BKdP2upAqmn) through wooded, empty bends - has now been stricken with significantly greater traffic (motorists and otherwise,) and blessed with roundabouts (https://beheard.como.gov/route-k-roundabout), as has Route WW East of US 63. The exact stretch of Missouri Route 179 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Route_179) on which Myke's Evo X made me yell cartoonishly (https://davidblue.wtf/evo) featured an actual pedestrian walking up a blind hill the first time I revisited last summer.\n\nThe simple explanation is that the mid-Missouri area surrounding Columbia which I will probably occupy until after my casket drops has expanded dramatically in population. In so many ways, I have struggled with little success to adapt to this fact, recently, to the misfortune of those around me, but in this crucial aspect of driving as recreation, I have found some hope in the form of digital tools. Rekindling my interest in manifesting a multi-use social service for driving enthusiasts have been RoadStr (https://app.roadstr.io/u/64dc60ffd1fd7c0011011807) and MyRoute (https://www.myrouteapp.com/profile/home/1269471) - both of which allow routes to be shared and published. They also both have CarPlay-enabled iOS apps, though I'm afraid neither represent a suitable replacement when one need actually navigate.\n\n\nThe most essential application that's enabled me to explore and publish routes to these services has been inRoute (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inroute-intelligent-routing/id703796787), which appears on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS via Catalyst (https://inroute.com/inroute-for-mac). Its CarPlay integration (https://inroute.com/inroute-guide-carplay) manages to be perhaps the most mature such experience I've encountered from a third-party app.\n\n[1]: Which, it's perhaps relevant to note, is for driving recreationally far more than most, if that's not obvious.\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","weight":1,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"db77abe7-8357-4fc9-a6e1-fca4778406cd","children":["89ed2f2a-67ff-46a7-b12f-0cd5cb9d136c"]},"89ed2f2a-67ff-46a7-b12f-0cd5cb9d136c":{"id":"89ed2f2a-67ff-46a7-b12f-0cd5cb9d136c","message":{"id":"89ed2f2a-67ff-46a7-b12f-0cd5cb9d136c","author":{"role":"assistant","metadata":{}},"create_time":1694775855.322852,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Thank you for sharing your draft.

It could benefit from a concise summary of what inRoute is and how it fits into your driving experience. This will give readers a clear idea of what to expect from the review.\n\n2. **Personal Experience:** Your personal anecdotes are valuable, but try to connect them more explicitly to the navigation app. For example, mention instances where you used or could have used inRoute during your drives.\n\n3. **Paragraph Structure:** Consider breaking down some of the longer paragraphs into shorter ones. This will make the text easier to read and navigate on a digital platform.\n\n4. **Hyperlinks:** While providing links to your Instagram and other websites is informative, ensure that these links are relevant to the review or add them in a footnote if they're more for personal reference.\n\n5. **Comparison:** It would be helpful to provide a brief comparison with other navigation apps you might have used in the past. This could give readers context about what makes inRoute unique.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Your draft doesn't seem to have a clear conclusion or summary of your thoughts on inRoute.

Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took me to write the [third-party Mastodon iOS app showcase](https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-apps) just before this item in *The Psalms*’ feed. If you’re new to this conversation, perhaps it’d be best to start in February of this year, with [Eugen’s announcement of the “official” Mastodon app’s development](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/) on the official Mastodon blog. “We need an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform,” argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating “the lack of an app that carries \\[Mastodon’s\\] name in the app stores trips up newcomers.” My first thought regarding the idea of an app *Specialized* in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who already call Mastodon our home. However, as a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mastodon) supporter of the Mastodon Project, I’ve had the privilege of testing the final result for the past five weeks, and I can tell ya… It is so much more than that.\n\n## Onboarding\n\nI’d like to offer the [demo video](https://youtu.be/bD8GQvNrE7E) embedded above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to declare it **the best all-around social network onboarding process currently available**. Having very recently slugged through the official Twitter app’s equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within this app are unbelievably exceptional.\n\n![Onboarding in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/P5oxTAg9.png)\n\nFirst, we’re presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,) organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I’ve failed to “sell” Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of confusion and I can’t imagine a better means of addressing it than the tool offered by this app. It’s beautiful and fast in a way previous utilities - like [instances.social](https://instances.social) - cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we’ve chosen a server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly readable document containing the “ground rules” set by its administrators. In my experience, these rules tend to be notably **easy-to-understand** and **not open to interpretation**, as if they were written primarily in the interest of community wellness rather than to construct a defense from legal action.\n\nAfter we’ve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we’ve chosen, it’s on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens of the social web have become accustomed - profile picture, username, email address, and password - but notably without the [inexplicable errors](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus) exhibited for years in Big Social’s equivalent functions. Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS’ implementation of the operating system's intra-app linking function (with the syntax `mastodon://`,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed *within the Mastodon app* instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This integration should not be remarkable, but - in the context of iOS development as it stands in 2021 - it most certainly is.\n\nAfter confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app’s “Find people to follow” function, which is informed by \"a mix of most followed accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post primarily in your language,\" as [Eugen explained](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440) in response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online - especially those who post the most. That's the whole bit! If you need \"proof,\" [here is the finished result](https://mastodon.online/@keys), but obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It's a cliché, yes, but seriously... What do you have to lose?)\n\n![Trending & Profile Editing in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/F21Jm29Q.png)\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Advantages\n\nOne of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party offerings has been the ability to edit one's profile information from within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a manner that puts Big Social's equivalents to shame. The ability to vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for instance, reflects insight only gained by *actually using these features*. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a Mastodon poll, for what that's worth.\n\n![Polling in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/NKHk8e1W.png)\n\n### Shortcuts\n\nAs of this writing, Mastodon for  iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support by way of a single action, entitled \"Post on Mastodon.\" Mostly in the interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts around this action on RoutineHub:\n\n1. \"**[Mastodon Share](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9776/)**\" - a text-only Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.\n\n2. \"**[Mastgur](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9781/)**\" - a more complicated Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the current Mastodon for iOS action's lack of multimedia support.\n\n![Siri Shortcuts for Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/H212I22P.png)\n\nMastodon friend Emma's [customization of the latter](https://mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com/@emma/106656610574981709) is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these (and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.\n\n## Challenges\n\nAs of this writing, coverage of the app’s release amounted only to [a single news item from ](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches)*[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches)*[’s Adi Robinson](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches), which notes the omission of local/federated “firehose” timeline views out of a desire to “reduce the potential for conflict with Apple.” (see: the Inc.’s [blatantly inconsistent enforcement](https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone) of its store policies in the past few months.) As a Mastodon user who *does* occasionally engage with my local and federated timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of third-party apps on iOS which *do* support said views and the app’s explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience disagrees with Eugen’s description of these timelines as a suboptimal means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I’ve found \\~70-80% of [the 600+ accounts I follow](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv), there. (Though it should be noted that I *do not* represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or behavior.)\n\nThough the onboarding process’ people to follow finder is pretty darn stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I’m sure this would be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I am 100% positive these omissions from the *initial release* version of this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the greater concept of Federation.\n\n![Composition Details in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/7UTf6Qyx.png)\n\nNaturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in hashtag iOS on the Fediverse: [no multiple account support](https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223)?! Perhaps you’ve already written me off as a mindless devotee, but - especially after exploring [the whole breadth of Mastodon apps available on iOS](https://github.com/extratone/mastodon-ios-apps) (all of which support multiple accounts) - the significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested, I personally feel *pretty well covered* when it comes to checking my (embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It’d be one thing if longtime users/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us, but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any other social media protocol. To decry this app - which was explicitly designed from the very beginning for new users - for skipping a function offered by *more than a dozen alternatives* is patently absurd. If you’ve got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly, order them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free, dependable [Amaroq](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amaroq-for-mastodon/id1214116200), and save Mastodon’s new app for your main.\n\n## Delights\n\nThe “relentless originality” I spoke of in my *third-party* showcase is no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette is a welcome departure from Tootsuite’s (the mother web application,) while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed throughout the app is adorable, as you’ve seen, and its bespoke audio player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.\n\n![Mastodon for iOS Audio Player](https://i.snap.as/IRzEOzXl.png)\n\nCustom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party apps, so the project-sourced app’s inclusion of the iconic Mastodon “boop” is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of substance to the whole experience.\n\nThough quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon app’s inclusion of **Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts** provoked a moment of true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my ‘*[iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard](https://github.com/extrakeys)* project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially “our” Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us “full keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.” (As of this writing, the award is just a “trophy.”)\n\n![Mastodon for iPhone - Universal Clacker Award](https://i.snap.as/H7NjCvd7.png)\n\nAn important consideration to inform the perspective through which we analyze such an app, I’d argue, is that **this app could have been very bad**. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking services/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well suggest it *should* have been bad. Had it been just mediocre, half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I’m sure I would still have paused everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an “objectively” excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of iPhone user *not* finding it refreshing in some way.\n\nI would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its craftsmanship, *but* they wouldn’t have exhausted reasons to use it. From the very first beta release I installed to the first release version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has *never* crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter’s official iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself. Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions only be performed with your app in focus - even when it surely makes no difference to your ad tech mechanism - and you have Mastodon’s single action, “Show When Run” toggle included.\n\nI’m not sure what I expected from an “official” Mastodon app upon first reading that winter blog post, but what I’ve been delivered is quite a gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was invested in this app"]},"status":"finished_successfully","weight":1,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"f6cbdb1f-558d-46b8-8e0c-8e4bb50aabd7","children":["91bac7b5-e35c-4df9-8ad1-e2c527cda37e"]},"91bac7b5-e35c-4df9-8ad1-e2c527cda37e":{"id":"91bac7b5-e35c-4df9-8ad1-e2c527cda37e","message":{"id":"91bac7b5-e35c-4df9-8ad1-e2c527cda37e","author":{"role":"assistant","metadata":{}},"create_time":1694777800.432874,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Thank you for sharing your review of Mastodon's native iOS app. Before I identify commonalities in the structure, let me provide some initial observations:\n\n1. **Introduction:** You start with a clear link to the app and mention the development process, providing context about why this app was created.

Perhaps inevitably, Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source developers have continued to embarrass the living fuck out of Twitter's team - at least for those who've continued to pay attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of aspiration has yet to perish.) \n\nI planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS development by watching closely for the first \"premium\" Mastodon clients to come out, which I suspected (quite correctly) would carry the first substantial risk-taking on the part of plucky social apps to be seen on the goddamned App Store in what felt like eternity. Unfortunately, I've ended up far too deep in screenshots/insights from **[Toot!](http://bit.ly/tootios)** and **[Mast](http://bit.ly/mastios)**, creating a bit of an overwhelming obstacle in comparing and/or reviewing the two without sinking deep in my regular, pretentious hole.

Here's part two:\n\nFirst, **a per­son­al obser­va­tion:** I’ve been tak­ing many of my notes late­ly on Twit­ter’s own ded­i­cat­ed [Mac app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id1482454543?mt=12), which has not been sub­ject to any major updates *in at least five years.* **Tweet­bot is better.**\n\n![Tweetbot 5 for iOS](https://i.snap.as/QSdd5po.png)\n\nI should also note that I am cur­rent­ly using Tweet­bot 5 (iOS) on an iPhone SE, 9to5Mac does not dis­close review tech hard­ware (to my knowl­edge,) and I’ll be focus­ing exclu­sive­ly on its core fea­tures and design *expe­ri­ence* rather than inno­va­tions and alter­ations since v4. Nota bene that Tap­bots is known for its accu­rate simul­tane­ity when it comes to update fea­tures across devices and its strong engage­ment with the Tweet­bot com­mu­ni­ty, so my cur­rent expe­ri­ence with the iOS app *should* remain rel­e­vant to any oth­er plat­form.\n\nFrom my iPhone SE’s start-up screen, I tried launch­ing both native Twit­ter and Tweet­bot sim­ul­ta­ne­ous­ly, both on Wifi and cel­lu­lar (LTE) con­nec­tions. The time it took for each to boot and refresh the home feed was **astound­ing­ly sim­i­lar,** so I wasn’t sur­prised to find that both per­formed *iden­ti­cal­ly* in app func­tion­al­i­ty speed. This dif­fer­ence in per­ceived speed from ver­sion 4 was quite start, actu­al­ly, and it’s a major improve­ment.\n\nThe feed stream itself remains a delight in Tweet­bot 5. Twit­ter for iOS is equal­ly impres­sive for how well it han­dles the feed, but its *tight* inte­gra­tion with the com­pa­ny’s web prod­uct feels heav­i­er than Tap­bots’ app and even exhibits a pesky ten­den­cy to forcibly refresh the page. Tweet­bot, by con­trast, nev­er* *jerks or sur­pris­es while open.\n\nThe iOS client *still* uses Twit­ter’s own (much dis­cussed, *much* mis­un­der­stood) APIs for every­thing, and the pro­found changes to its basic func­tion­al­i­ty have final­ly become enough to drive me to invest the time nec­es­sary to reclaim the abil­i­ty to com­pose tweets from the comfort of [a news­read­er](https://bilge.world/amp/2020/09/republicofnews).\n\nLet’s talk about com­po­si­tion in Tweet­bot 5 for iOS. Above, I com­mend­ed the app’s scrollable com­pose but­ton (aka the com­pose but­ton was “float­ed”) for its poten­tial usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over the native app’s equiv­a­lent. For­get that! **The com­pose but­ton has been dis­patched alto­geth­er**, tak­en on by Apple’s lazy bot­tom nav­i­ga­tion par­a­digm and Tweetbot’s design team took this oppor­tu­ni­ty to go entire­ly wild.\n\n**Tweet­bot 5's Big Secret: There’s no longer a but­ton to com­pose tweets.**\n\n**Explain**\n\nIt’s very very impor­tant to me that you under­stand this change. **You can com­pose tweets from any­where in the app, now.** Unlike most of the dis­joint­ed, com­pli­cat­ed and mal­func­tion­ing com­pose flows in Twit­ter’s cur­rent app, Tweet­bot has cho­sen not to spe­cial case or seg­ment the process of tweet­ing.\n\nSure, this sounds like the kind of rad­i­cal change that dri­ves users away, but it’s com­plete­ly **intu­itive.** Sim­ply:\n\n1. **Tap** the but­ton to enter “com­pose mode.” (Or tap and hold for a very slight [and very cool] ani­ma­tion of the but­ton become a [pen nib](https://i.snap.as/f9fEaX4.png)).\n\n2. **Begin typ­ing** any­thing. What you see is *exact­ly* what you get.\n\n3. **Tap the “X” but­ton** to dis­card the draft and can­cel the tweet.\n\n4. **Tap the \"Tweet\" but­ton** (for­mer­ly the send but­ton) when you’re ready to send.\n\n**That’s it.** When I say intu­itive, I mean that I was *fully* expect­ing to have to “"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"max_tokens"},"is_complete":true,"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","parent_id":"b06a4655-e0cb-45ed-a98e-8fb1df9167b4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"b06a4655-e0cb-45ed-a98e-8fb1df9167b4","children":["d8f3ed52-a917-48fd-97b9-a4856e33dfe8"]},"d8f3ed52-a917-48fd-97b9-a4856e33dfe8":{"id":"d8f3ed52-a917-48fd-97b9-a4856e33dfe8","message":{"id":"d8f3ed52-a917-48fd-97b9-a4856e33dfe8","author":{"role":"user","metadata":{}},"create_time":1694778839.351627,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here's the second part:\n\n> We’ve got a shiny, new com­pose but­ton to unveil on Twit­ter for iOS!

Enter Tweetbot 5, the latest iteration of a beloved third-party Twitter client. As someone who appreciates innovative software and values a unique user experience, I felt compelled to delve into what Tweetbot 5 has to offer.\n\n*Initial Impressions and App Landscape*\n\nOn Windows XP ballot day, I couldn't help but marvel at the seemingly abrupt availability of genuinely innovative social apps on the Apple App Store. It had been a while since we'd seen such innovation since the days of iOS 7. While some may view a sneak peek, NDA-violating app review as trivial, I believe discussing software, especially when it's something as widely used as Twitter, is crucial. After all, these apps and the companies behind them have the potential to shape the digital world.\n\nTweetbot's latest iteration immediately caught my attention, justifying the existence of its dedicated subreddit. I've had my fair share of complaints about Twitter's treatment of third-party clients, but I never expected Tweetbot to still be around, let alone preparing a release that would surpass its competition, including Twitter's own native app. It seemed like Tweetbot was poised to redefine stability and aesthetics in the Twitter client landscape.\n\n*The Twitter App Ecosystem*\n\nTwitter, once home to a diverse landscape of third-party clients and tools, had become increasingly hostile toward them, albeit for justifiable reasons. While I had accepted that the era of small, independent teams creating powerful Twitter apps had come to an end, Tweetbot's resurgence was a pleasant surprise. It even managed to outshine Twitter's native app, which had undergone significant cosmetic surgery.\n\nTwitter's move of relocating the compose button to the bottom right-hand corner, following the trend of one-handed scrolling, seemed like an attempt to compete with third-party clients. However, it raised questions about usability and user experience.\n\n*The Return of Third-Party Clients*\n\nTwit­ter Sup­port, known for its less glamorous presence compared to celebrities like Cher, made a significant announcement about a new compose button. Yet, it seemed odd that such a fundamental change in Twitter's infrastructure garnered limited attention, considering the platform's massive user base. It highlighted the importance of user engagement, especially when changes affect the daily lives of millions.\n\nIn the glory days of Twitter, I used to spend my community college classes tweeting from my phone. Back then, there was a plethora of third-party clients available, each with its unique features and quirks. These clients filled the tech world with a cacophony of opinions and reviews.\n\n*The Era of Third-Party Twitter Clients*\n\nNow, let's delve into the cream of the crop: Twitterific and Tweetbot. I have a long-standing affection for Tweetbot. It was during my community college days that I first invested in Tweetbot 3 for my iPhone 4S, driven by the immense hype surrounding it. The app lived up to its reputation, offering speed and smoothness that even Twitter's native app couldn't match.\n\nHowever, I must admit that the bloggers and YouTubers who claimed that premium apps like Tweetbot could entirely replace Twitter's native app were somewhat delusional. While Tweetbot addressed many issues, its Achilles' heel was notifications. The sporadic and unpredictable arrival of notifications disrupted the sense of being plugged in, similar to Chuck Klosterman's exploration of DVRing live sports.\n\n*The Quest for Immediacy*\n\nLive events like sports games hold our fascination not because of immediacy but because they represent moments where the entire spectrum of possibility is in play. Tweetbot, while superior in many aspects, couldn't replicate this live experience, thanks to Twitter's API limitations.\n\nIn essence, there's no reason to completely delete the Twitter app. You can hide it away in a folder while keeping its notifications active. This workflow might seem unconventional, but it worked for a long time, despite occasional discrepancies between Tweetbot's Mentions tab and the native app's instant notifications.\n\n*The Last Competitive Third-Party Twitter App for iOS*\n\nAs of Tweetbot 5's release, it's safe to say that this might be the last competitive third-party Twitter app for iOS. Twitter, Inc. has made it clear that it prioritizes its own clients over maintaining the APIs required for others to receive push notifications. TweetDeck, once a popular alternative, was absorbed into Twitter's ecosystem.\n\nStatistics showed a decline in users installing third-party Twitter clients, making it unlikely that apps like Echofon, TweetCaster, or Twitterific would remain available. Tweetbot and Twitterific, however, are different. They aren't just satellite products; they played a significant role in shaping Twitter's platform.\n\n*The Challenge of Staying Relevant*\n\nWhile many third-party clients have struggled to keep up with updates and remain compatible with newer iOS versions, Tweetbot and Twitterific have managed to stay afloat. Their longevity is remarkable, given the dynamic nature of the platform. Tweetbot's reliability and usability have been consistent since iOS 7.\n\n*The User Experience and Accessibility*\n\nIt's frustrating to be treated like an idiotic user rather than an intelligent one. Some apps oversimplify user interactions, assuming that users can't handle more advanced features. In the case of the native Twitter app, its functions are geared towards the lowest common denominator, missing out on the potential for a richer user experience.\n\nAccessibility should be a priority for social media platforms, and Twitter has faced criticism for its lack of investment in this area. Access should be equal for everyone, regardless of their abilities. Neglecting accessibility can undermine the professionalism of social media managers and limit their capabilities.\n\n*The Power of Lists*\n\nLists, often overlooked but incredibly powerful, are a game-changer in managing Twitter. Both Tweetbot and Twitterific recognized the potential of lists and invested in their functionality. Lists offer the ability to filter and sort incoming content, allowing users to tailor their Twitter experience precisely. They provide a level of control and organization that can't be ignored.\n\n*Tweeting with Tweetbot 5*\n\nReturning to Tweetbot 5 in 2018 brought back a sense of familiarity and innovation. The app retains its charm with animation and audio notifications that seamlessly blend into the user experience. The ability to switch between color themes with a simple two-fingered swipe is a noteworthy addition, making it a compelling choice for users willing to invest $4.99 for a superior Twitter experience.\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nIn conclusion, Tweetbot 5 stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of third-party Twitter clients. Despite the limitations imposed by Twitter, Inc., it manages to offer a robust and feature-rich alternative to the native app. The combination of familiarity, innovation, and user control makes it a top choice for Twitter enthusiasts.\n\n---\n\nYour comprehensive review of Tweetbot 5 provides valuable insights into the Twitter app landscape, the importance of user experience and accessibility, and the enduring appeal of third-party clients.
