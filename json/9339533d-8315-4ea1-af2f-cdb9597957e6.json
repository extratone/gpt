Even if you identify identical attributes, there's the matter of determining whether it is an accidental duplicate to be deleted, whether it is a deliberate duplicate to be preserved, and what may be a false positive caused by unique items with similar or identical attributes to each other (e.g., domain, username, item name). Even \"exact duplicate\" is difficult to actually pin down and it could be easy to miss real duplicates that aren't exact matches (e.g., two items that differ only by a UTM suffix on the website value). And finally, once suspected duplicates are identified, there's then the matter of choosing which duplicate is the canonical item. A script is just not going to offer sufficient ability to review suspected duplicates before acting.\nPersonally I think this is something better handled by the client applications than a CLI script. The client applications have considerable advantages in terms of performance and UX that the CLI could never match, particularly since evaluating duplicates is subjective and usually involves input from the user on a per-item basis.\nFor many of the reasons above, a general-purpose or broadly-applicable de-duplication script is going to be practically impossible to put together, even for exact matches. At best, it may be possible to use the CLI to address a specific incident that resulted in duplicates with very predictable attributes.\nI do not want to dismiss the possibility we may explore an example script at some point, but at this time there are other use-cases that the CLI is more well-suited to address that we will be prioritizing for future examples. But please don't let that stop you from experimenting with approaches, involving the CLI or otherwise, for de-duping.\nThis is kind of a non-answer, but I want to leave you with something to go on at least. I'm sure you've encountered these before, but some suggestions:\n\t•\tUse watchtower to find instances of reused passwords. In theory items with identical passwords are highly likely to be duplicates.\n\t•\tUse a 1Password desktop application to sort items by title. There's a high likelihood duplicates will have the same or similar titles. You can quickly compare the contents to two seemingly identical items.\n\t•\tDeal with duplicates as they present themselves. In theory, duplicates will have the same domain, so they'll all show up when you go to log into that website. If you notice this, you can deal with those duplicates in that moment, and over time, deal with duplicates for your most commonly-used items.\nThanks for your interest in our new examples repo, and although I can't make any promises about a de-duplication script any time soon, I hope you'll continue to experiment with the 1Password CLI!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","weight":1,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"3f0ddfa6-409a-46ae-9a2b-f197c854b74d","children":["ab727fc8-480d-45ec-848f-bdfc0d443e37"]},"ab727fc8-480d-45ec-848f-bdfc0d443e37":{"id":"ab727fc8-480d-45ec-848f-bdfc0d443e37","message":{"id":"ab727fc8-480d-45ec-848f-bdfc0d443e37","author":{"role":"assistant","metadata":{}},"create_time":1693516685.702639,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The comment discusses the requests for deduplication support in 1Password.
