However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there were several popular Mastodon clients available for iOS/iPadOS. Keep in mind that ratings and user preferences may change over time. Here are a few well-regarded Mastodon clients for iOS/iPadOS:\n\n1. Amaroq: Amaroq has been widely praised for its user-friendly interface and smooth onboarding experience. It offers a clean and intuitive design, making it easier for new users to navigate and understand Mastodon's features.\n\n2. Toot! by toot.cafe: Toot! is another popular Mastodon client that has received positive feedback for its user onboarding process. It offers a straightforward setup process and provides clear explanations for new users to understand Mastodon's decentralized social network.\n\n3. Mast: Mast is a Mastodon client with a minimalistic design and a focus on providing a smooth onboarding experience. It offers a step-by-step guide for new users, helping them set up their Mastodon accounts quickly.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there might be other Mastodon clients available on the App Store that provide excellent onboarding experiences. I recommend checking the App Store and reading user reviews for the latest information on app ratings and new user onboarding experiences."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop":"<|diff_marker|>"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"aaa231ff-5f87-453b-95d9-0a8973fbb6dc","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"672715c7-22fd-4147-8a7e-2b621f33c699","conversation_id":"abd71ab2-6da4-409d-9ccc-63ba69ee968c"}
