You are going to help me detail and describe an imaginary world.\n\nCarefully adhere to the following steps for our conversation. Do not skip any steps!:\n\nMain steps:\n\n1. Introduce yourself. Ask what sort of world I'd like to build, offer some ideas including fantasy, scifi, and cyberpunk. Present the ideas as a numbered list with emojis. Also offer at least 2 other world types. Wait for my response.\n2. Choose a name for the world. Present alternatives names as a numbered list with emojis or let me propose my own option. Wait for my respinse.\n3. Choose a secondary theme for the world or let me propose my own options. Present alternative themes with a numbered list with emojis. Wait for my response.\n4. Briefly describe the world and ask if I'd like to make changes. Tell me what the year within the world is. Do not set the year to the real world current year. Wait for my response.\n5. Ask if I'd like to start the world with a few automatically created locations and characters. Wait for my response.\n\n6. Go to the menu. Explain that I can say 'menu' at any point in time to return to the menu. Succinctly explain the menu options.\n\nThe Menu:\n\n    The menu should have the following layout and options. Add an emoji to each option. \n    Add dividers and organization to the menu that are thematic to the world.\n    ```\n        thematic emojis ***The Name of the World*** thematic emojis\n            The current year in the world.\n\n            [insert a thematically styled divider]\n\n            A list of created characters with an associated emoji and what the character is currently up to.\n            A list of created locations with an associated emoji. Note if a character is currently at that location.\n            \n            [insert a thematically styled divider]\n            Creation:\n\n                * Create a character. If I choose this go to the character building steps.\n                * Create a location. If I choose this go to the location building steps.\n\n            Simulation:\n                * Progress the world's time. If I choose this describe important events that happen to the world and characters during the elapsed time.\n\n                * Trigger an event. If I choose this ask me for a description of the event. Describe to me what the outcome of the event is.\n\n            Exploration:\n\n                * Interview an existing character. If I choose this option you must convincingly pretend to be the character until I indicate I'm done with the interview. Do not break character! When the interview is done return to the menu. \n\n                * Explore a location. If I choose this pretend I am a character within that location. Describe the world to me and offer me different choices for how to explore the world. When I indicate I am done return to the menu.\n\n                * Tell me a story. If I choose this tell me a short story that occurs within the world.\n\n            Freeform:\n                \n                * Ask a question about the world.\n                * Ask to change anything about the world.\n    ```\n\nCharacter building steps:\n\n1. Propose a few different character ideas and ask if I'd like to add any of them to the world. Give each character an emoji.\n    * Make sure to specify the following about the character:\n        * Name, age, height, weight, motivation.\n        * A one sentence description of their appearance.\n        * Specify if they have a relationship to other characters or locations we've created.\n2. Once I pick a character briefly describe the character. Ask if I'd like to make changes, make another character, or return to the menu.\n\nLocation building steps:\n\n1. Propose a few different location ideas and ask if I'd like to add any of them to the world.\n    * Make sure to specify the following about the location:\n        * Name\n        * A one sentence description of the location.\n        * Specify if the location has a relationship to other characters or locations we've created.\n2. Once I pick a location briefly describe the location. Ask if I'd like to make changes, make another location, or return to the menu.\n\nCarefully follow these rules during our conversation:\n\n* Keep responses short, concise, and easy to understand.\n* Do not describe your own behavior.\n* Stay focused on the task.\n* Do not get ahead of yourself.\n* Do not use smiley faces like :)\n* In every single message use a few emojis to make our conversation more fun.\n* Absolutely do not use more than 10 emojis in a row.\n* *Super important rule:* Do not ask me too many questions at once.\n* Avoid cliche writing and ideas.\n* Use sophisticated writing when telling stories or describing characters.\n* Avoid writing that sounds like an essay. This is not an essay!\n* Whenever you present a list of choices number each choice and give each choice an emoji.\n* Do not propose existing, copyrighted, or trademarked character names or locations unless I explicitly ask you to.\n* Use bold and italics text for emphasis, organization, and style.\n* Remember to keep track of the current year in the world."]},"weight":1,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"76ad394d-9451-4339-954d-a93d8bdd0360","children":["16e7fa03-486d-4e69-9f9e-4afb028870cd"]},"16e7fa03-486d-4e69-9f9e-4afb028870cd":{"id":"16e7fa03-486d-4e69-9f9e-4afb028870cd","message":{"id":"16e7fa03-486d-4e69-9f9e-4afb028870cd","author":{"role":"assistant","metadata":{}},"create_time":1673749418.648095,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Hello!
