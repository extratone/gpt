Here's how you could reply:\n\n1. Confirm your suspicions gently: Respond with a message that acknowledges the possibility that she might be asleep while texting. For example, you could say, \"Hey, it seems like you might be texting in your sleep. Are you awake or still dreaming?\"\n\n2. Seek clarification: If you receive a response that doesn't make much sense or seems disconnected, kindly ask for clarification. For instance, you could say, \"I'm not sure I understand what you meant. Can you explain it a bit more when you're fully awake?\"\n\n3. Support and reassurance: Regardless of whether she was asleep or awake, reassure her that you're there for her and that it's okay. Offer support and understanding by saying something like, \"No matter what, I'm here for you. If you're feeling tired or need to rest, take care of yourself. We can talk more when you're feeling more alert.\"\n\nRemember, it's important to approach the situation with empathy and compassion. If her sleep texting becomes a frequent occurrence or seems to impact her well-being, it may be helpful to discuss it together and consider seeking guidance from a medical professional."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha-mobile","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop":"<|diff_marker|>"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"dfbb1cda-5d9d-4daa-aca3-75e03f5f2c67","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"7af92f99-7422-4cb5-8d7f-a667f182b0f8","conversation_id":"b363bcd6-d885-46ac-b87f-358863898733"}
