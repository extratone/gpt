Use the \"#\" symbol to indicate headings. You can use one \"#\" for the top-level heading and add more \"#\" for subheadings. \n2. Use \"-\" or \"*\" to create bullet lists for the flight times summary, fuel usage summary, flight parameters, flight route and comments sections.\n3. Use \"|\" to separate the columns in the flight times summary, fuel usage summary, flight parameters, flight route and comments sections.\n4. Use \"**\" to bold the text that you want to emphasize, such as the \"PILOT: EXTRATONE\" and \"FLIGHT: GASSY 60 (LIPA - LOWG)\"\n5. Use \"`\" to indicate code or terminal text\n\nOnce you have applied these techniques, you will get markdown formatted text.\n\nHere is an example of how the first few lines of the text you provided might look in Markdown:\n```\n# USAF\n\n**PILOT: EXTRATONE**\n\n**FLIGHT: GASSY 60 (LIPA - LOWG)**\nDEPARTURE RUNWAY: 05\nARRIVAL RUNWAY: 34C\nAIRCRAFT: DC-10F\n\n## FLIGHT TIMES SUMMARY\n\n- OUT 1017Z/1117L | ON 1052Z/1152L\n- TAXI 00:05 | TAXI 00:02\n- OFF 1022Z/1122L | IN 1055Z/1155L\n- TIME IN AIR       00:30\n- TOTAL FLIGHT TIME 00:38\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that the final format depends on your specific needs and the level of detail you want to maintain.\n"]},"end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop":"<|im_end|>"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"0a900c4a-4365-4887-9164-0a025b9e34ce","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"9203c5a3-6f0f-40ec-a22d-e9bd1a9e1e3b"}
