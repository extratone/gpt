Somehow, the idea that one might store words that don’t necessarily appear in any dictionary seems a foreign one to the creators of LookUp, which I’ve since found out to be the cause of [its Siri Shortcuts actions failing on me](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328\n\n[Terminology](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) *does* support adding “custom” terms, if unintentionally, through its “notes” function. Because it’s related to Drafts (they’re from the same creator,) it was quite easy to “integrate” the two in order to form the workflow you see demonstrated in [the video below](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/165031796-5df78c01-faee-4fd4-84d0-f0bf95fd383f.MOV).\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Q04Kxrg\n\nFirst, I use the [Lookup in Terminology action](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1CS) paired with a keyboard shortcut (`^⇧D`) in Drafts to search a selected word in Terminology. There, I “like” the word and - if needed - add a definition via the notes button (immediately to the left of the heart in the upper right corner.) I’ve configured a custom button - “[Drafts-definition](terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&shortName=Drafts&description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&dispatchType=0\nterminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&shortName=Drafts&description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&dispatchType=0)” - (which you should be able to import with that hyperlink) that sends the term *including its notes* back to Drafts with the following configuration:\n\n```\ndrafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]\n```\n\nThat button results in a new Draft in a specific format, demonstrated by this example:\n\n![Antagonistic Vocabulary Draft Example](https://i.snap.as/K0adnLf5.png)\n\nI then manually add the “Vocabulary” tag to the Draft, completing the process and placing it within the parameters defined by [my Vocabulary workspace](https://directory.getdrafts.com/w/1zN), which shows only drafts with that tag, sorted alphabetically.\n\n## Publication\n\nFor the past few weeks, I’ve been wreaking havoc on NeoCities’ global activity feed using [the action group I created](https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities) on [the /drafts directory](https://davidblue.wtf/drafts) of davidblue dot wtf.

This summer has abruptly brought some life happens which will inevitably contribute further changes to a degree that warrants a very bloggy sort of Update Post.\n\nMost importantly, perhaps, is that I've found myself with a real, tangible, full-time Big Boy job as a nighttime custodian of *my actual elementary school*. Though I suppose it's never been revealed before, here, I actually love cleaning and love this school, particularly, so I'm more excited than I've ever been for any sort of documentable employment, but this means I will imminently be transitioning from a lifestyle with virtually zero time-bound obligations to working 3-11:15PM, Monday through Friday.

Some highlights from this discovery (in this particular, Title I Midwestern elementary school):\n\n- Every child will receive a 5th-generation, WiFi-only iPad ([iPad6,11](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/specs/apple-ipad-9-7-inch-early-2017-wi-fi-only-specs.html)) which they will be able to take home over the course of the school year.\n- The district paid $299 per unit for said iPads, a mere $30 off their full retail price for the rest of us, $329.\n- The random device I picked up from the pile shown in the images embedded above had not been updated beyond iPadOS 15 (since March of this year.)\n- Responsibility for the maintenance, setup, and deployment of said iPads rests entirely on a single individual, who is also responsible for the \"media center\" (what many of us know as the *Library*.)\n- Responsibility for ongoing hardware considerations (charging and storage) is left entirely to individual teachers.\n- Net contributions from Apple, Inc. to this new aspect of childhood education reside some six or seven figures *in the negative*. \n\nIn the two weeks preceding our district's start date, I had the painful opportunity to tour some of my friend's colleagues' storage solutions for their student iPads. The image below is the one I chose to append to my appeal to the *MacStories* Discord, attempting to *leverage* workspace-obsessed yuppies' knowledge for the benefit of public education.\n\n![Sad iPad Rack](https://i.snap.as/1o0iA322.png)\n\nThere were a few helpful replies, which made it clear that organizations with actual budgets for device storage have gravitated toward rolling carts.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve been made intimately aware just how integral YouTube has become in public education, these past few weeks. believe it or not, there is not a program - to the educators I&#39;ve spoken to&#39;s knowledge, anyway - that removes advertising from YouTube playback in this case.</p>&mdash; ⓓⓐⓥⓘⓓ ⓑⓛⓤⓔ (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1565127670345744388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n## Going Forward\n\nThe time I haven't spent in this medium has been redirected toward a few key sources.

I doubt you want to hear much about it, but the issue of actually *obtaining audio files* from the Screw collection is a worthwhile one to engage for context's sake. I was first introduced to the ~343-chapter collection by my high school best friend, who'd acquired it via an ancient Pirate Bay torrent some hero set up in the early 2000s[^1]. It was complete - probably - and more or less correctly organized *by chapter*, but that's about it as far as reliable metadata was concerned. The results one would find elsewhere on the web, from [sites like DatPiff](https://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-search.php?criteria=keyword:dj+screw), were hardly any better - many, in fact, were obviously sourced from that same torrent.\n\n![DJ Screw on the iTunes Store and Apple Music](https://i.snap.as/WB5CXuSz.png)\n\n<a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dj-screw/80923709?itsct=music_box_badge&amp;itscg=30200&amp;app=music&amp;ls=1\" style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;\"><img src=\"https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/listen-on-apple-music/badge/en-us?size=250x83&h=cdbcefe9e23b0310ab61b31e72e2dcdb\" alt=\"Listen on Apple Music\" style=\"border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;\"></a>\n\nIn the interim, a lot has changed about music consumption.
