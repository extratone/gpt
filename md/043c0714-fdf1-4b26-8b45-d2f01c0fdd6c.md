# Gas Price Sign Update

#### You:
I need to change the (physical, non-digital) price signs of my gas station. If I tell you the current values on the sign for each of the 3 displayed grades and the new values they need to be, can you tell me which individual numbers I need to bring out with me and in which order to slide them in?

#### You:
Is there an actual term that differentiates the kind of signage we're talking about - with numbers that slot into plastic rails - from the kind that are digital?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, the type of signage with numbers that slot into plastic rails is often referred to as "manual" or "analog" price signs or signage. In contrast, digital signs use electronic displays to show the prices and are commonly known as "digital price signs" or "electronic price displays." These terms help differentiate between the traditional manual signs and the more modern digital alternatives.
