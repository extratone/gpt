# AI vs. Freelance Writer

#### You:
Compared with the cost to commission a freelance writer for ad copy, say, do you find yourself to be a worthwhile investment taking into account the sum total of human time and resources expended toward your existence?

#### ChatGPT:
As an AI language model, I don't have a personal stake in my own existence, so I don't have an opinion on whether I am a worthwhile investment compared to a freelance writer for ad copy. However, I can provide some information that may be useful in considering this question.

Firstly, the cost of commissioning a freelance writer for ad copy will depend on various factors, such as the writer's experience, the length and complexity of the ad copy, and the deadline for completion. These costs can vary widely and may or may not be comparable to the cost of developing and training an AI language model like myself.

When considering the value of investing in an AI language model, it's important to keep in mind that such models can perform a wide range of language-related tasks beyond just writing ad copy. For example, I can assist with writing, editing, and proofreading content, generating ideas, conducting research, and answering questions on a wide range of topics.

Additionally, AI language models like myself can work around the clock without needing breaks or rest, and can process vast amounts of data much more quickly than a human writer could. This can make AI language models a valuable resource for businesses or individuals who need to complete language-related tasks quickly and efficiently.

Ultimately, whether investing in an AI language model like myself or hiring a freelance writer for ad copy is a better choice depends on the specific needs and priorities of the individual or business in question.


#### You:
Are you able to estimate the sum of all money spent in research and development throughout the history of artificial intelligence ( including the cost of your individual project) so that we could have this chat today?

#### ChatGPT:
It's difficult to estimate the exact sum of all money spent on research and development throughout the history of artificial intelligence, as it spans several decades and involves numerous projects, organizations, and countries. However, according to a recent report by McKinsey Global Institute, AI-related investment (including research and development, as well as deployment and adoption) has been growing rapidly, with global investment in AI reaching an estimated $26 billion to $39 billion in 2019 alone.

As for my own development, I was created by OpenAI, a research organization that was founded in 2015 with a mission to develop safe and beneficial AI. While I don't have access to information on the exact cost of my development, I know that OpenAI has received significant funding from various sources, including investors such as Microsoft and the founders of LinkedIn and Yelp. OpenAI has also invested in developing other AI systems and technologies beyond just language models like myself.

Overall, it's safe to say that significant financial resources have been invested in the research and development of artificial intelligence over the years, including the development of language models like myself, which has contributed to the advancement of AI technology and made conversations like this possible.


#### You:
Are you able to estimate how much the global advertising industry has spent on copy since 2019?

#### ChatGPT:
As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data on global advertising spending or the exact amount spent on copy specifically. However, according to a report by Statista, global advertising spending was expected to reach around $634 billion in 2020, with digital advertising accounting for a growing share of that spending. This includes spending on various advertising mediums such as television, print, radio, outdoor advertising, and online advertising.

It's worth noting that the amount spent on copy specifically can vary widely depending on the nature of the advertising campaign and the scope of the copywriting work involved. Additionally, many companies may handle their own copywriting in-house, rather than outsourcing it to freelance writers or agencies.
