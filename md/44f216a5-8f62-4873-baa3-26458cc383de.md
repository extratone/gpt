Public school teachers often employ several effective methods to save money when buying supplies for their classrooms:

1. **Utilize Discounts and Sales:** Look for teacher discounts at stores like office supply retailers, craft stores, and online marketplaces. Many stores offer special deals for educators.

2. **Shop Secondhand:** Visit thrift stores, garage sales, or online platforms for gently used classroom supplies. You can find items like books, storage containers, and furniture at lower costs.

3. **Use Grants and Donations:** Apply for grants or crowdfunding platforms to secure funding for classroom supplies. Websites like DonorsChoose.org can help connect teachers with potential donors.

4. **Join Teacher Exchanges:** Participate in teacher exchange programs where educators swap or share supplies, books, and materials with each other.

5. **Bulk Purchasing:** Buy supplies in bulk to save money in the long run. Look for bulk deals on items like paper, pens, and art supplies.

6. **Repurpose and DIY:** Get creative by repurposing everyday items or creating your own teaching materials. Pinterest and educational blogs often have DIY ideas.

7. **Use Technology Wisely:** Utilize free or low-cost digital resources, such as educational apps, online worksheets, and virtual manipulatives.

8. **Parent and Community Involvement:** Engage parents and local businesses in supporting your classroom by donating supplies or funds.

9. **Stock Up During Sales Tax Holidays:** Take advantage of sales tax holidays in your region to purchase supplies without paying sales tax.

10. **Plan and Budget:** Create a clear budget for your classroom expenses and prioritize essential items. Planning ahead can help you avoid overspending.

Remember that resourcefulness and networking can go a long way in finding cost-effective solutions for classroom supplies.
