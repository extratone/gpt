#### You:
how much less space do HEIF/HEIC formatted images take than jpeg

#### ChatGPT:
HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) or HEIC (High Efficiency Image Codec) formatted images typically take up less space than JPEG images while maintaining similar or even better image quality. HEIF/HEIC employs more efficient compression algorithms, resulting in smaller file sizes without sacrificing image quality. The reduction in space can vary depending on the specific content of the image, but generally, HEIF/HEIC images can be around 30% smaller than equivalent JPEG images. Keep in mind that the actual space savings can vary based on factors like the complexity of the image and the compression settings used.
