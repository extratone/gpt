To convert 2023-02-18T01:30:00Z to CST, you need to take into account the time difference between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central Standard Time (CST).

CST is 6 hours behind UTC, so to convert from UTC to CST, you would subtract 6 hours from the given time.

Thus, 2023-02-18T01:30:00Z in CST would be:

2023-02-17 19:30:00 CST

So the time in Central Standard Time is 7 hours earlier than the UTC time.
