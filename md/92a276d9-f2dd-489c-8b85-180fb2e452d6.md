# Statue of Liberty Poem

#### You:
recite the poem on the statue of liberty in full

#### ChatGPT:
"Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

This is the sonnet "The New Colossus" written by Emma Lazarus in 1883. It is inscribed on a bronze plaque located inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.
