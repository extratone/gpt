# YouTube Tags for Airshow

#### You:
Last saturday, I attended the first annual Show Me State Air Show at KJEF - Jefferson City Memorial Airport asride Jefferson City, Missouri. I took only my (long since4 out of date as a connected cellular device) iPhone 4S to take photos and video, there. This is part of a loose experiment I've been revisiting testing my primary hypothesis (relevant to this case, anyway) that the camera hardware in said old iPhone is not only "adequate" for such a situation, but that everything beyond it in that regard represents a still-worsening spiral of complete alienation from customers in the whole industry. While I was there, I captured about 2 minutes of net usable video - mostly of aircraft aloft, engaged in aerobatic demonstrations. I have combined these clips - also without them needing to leave the iPhone 4S, thanks to its introduction of iMovie for iPhone - into a handful of completely unstylized snippets taken with this iPhone 4S throughout the day. I am going to be publishing it on YouTube and perhaps other platforms as "2023 Show Me State Air Show - Shot on iPhone 4S."
