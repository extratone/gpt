# Hungry? Choose Healthy!

#### You:
I am hungo hungo. what eat

#### ChatGPT:
As an AI language model, I'm sorry but I'm unable to determine what you mean by "hungo hungo." If you mean that you're feeling hungry, then some healthy food options include:

- Fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains, such as brown rice or quinoa
- Lean protein, such as chicken, fish, or tofu
- Legumes, such as beans or lentils
- Nuts and seeds
- Low-fat dairy products

It's important to choose foods that will provide you with sustained energy and essential nutrients to fuel your body throughout the day. Remember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, as well.
