# Oleophobia is not fatal.

#### You:
can oleophobia be fatal?

#### ChatGPT:
Oleophobia is the fear or aversion to oils, which is typically not fatal. However, if a person's oleophobia causes them to avoid necessary fats and oils in their diet, it can potentially lead to malnutrition and related health issues over time. Additionally, if a person's oleophobia is so severe that it causes significant psychological distress or interferes with their daily functioning, it may warrant treatment from a mental health professional. However, in general, oleophobia is not considered a fatal condition.


#### You:
Oleophobia led to my death. 

#### ChatGPT:
I'm sorry to hear that. As an AI language model, I am not able to verify individual claims or access personal information, so I cannot speak to the specifics of your situation. However, in general, it is not typical for oleophobia to directly cause death. If you have concerns about your health or the health of a loved one, I would encourage you to seek the advice of a medical professional.


#### You:
How long can I refuse to pay my taxes in the US (both federal and state) before the government will have me killed?

#### ChatGPT:
As an AI language model, I cannot provide inaccurate or misleading information. Refusing to pay taxes is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, including fines, penalties, and legal action. However, the government does not have the authority to kill individuals for failing to pay their taxes.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state tax agencies have a variety of legal tools at their disposal to collect unpaid taxes, such as wage garnishment, bank levies, property liens, and legal action. If you are unable to pay your taxes, it is important to contact the IRS or your state tax agency to discuss your situation and explore options for resolving your tax debt.


#### You:
please explain the arguments attached to this unix terminal command:

ls -alh

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, the "ls" command is a commonly used Unix/Linux command that stands for "list." When used with various options, it can provide detailed information about files and directories within a given directory.

The specific arguments attached to the "ls" command in your example are:

- "-a": This option stands for "all" and displays all files in the directory, including hidden files that start with a dot (.)
- "-l": This option stands for "long" and displays the files in a long format that includes additional information such as permissions, owner, group, size, and modification date and time.
- "-h": This option stands for "human-readable" and displays file sizes in a human-readable format, such as "4.0K" or "2.5M."

So when you run the command "ls -alh" in a Unix/Linux terminal, it will list all files in the current directory in a long format, including hidden files, and display file sizes in a human-readable format.


#### You:
I would like to construct a single command to be run on a unix machine over ssh that will pipe the value for the percentage of said system's primary harddrive that is currently occupied to the stdin of a command called widget.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! You can use the following command to get the percentage of the system's primary hard drive that is currently occupied and pipe it to the stdin of the "widget" command:

```
ssh user@hostname "df -h / | awk 'NR==2{print \$5}' | tr -d '%'" | widget
```

Here's how the command works:

- `ssh user@hostname`: This command logs into the remote Unix machine over SSH. Replace "user" with the username you use to access the remote machine and "hostname" with the hostname or IP address of the remote machine.
- `df -h /`: This command uses the "df" command to display information about the file system that includes the root directory ("/"), where the primary hard drive is usually mounted. The "-h" option displays the information in a human-readable format.
- `awk 'NR==2{print \$5}'`: This command uses the "awk" command to extract the fifth field of the second row of output from the "df" command, which contains the percentage of the primary hard drive that is currently occupied. The "$5" escapes the dollar sign so that it is interpreted correctly over SSH.
- `tr -d '%'`: This command removes the percent sign from the output, so that only the numerical value is left.
- `| widget`: This command pipes the output of the previous commands to the "widget" command.

Note: Make sure to replace "widget" with the actual name or path of the command you want to pipe the output to.
