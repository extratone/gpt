# Extracting full_text values.

#### You:
In the dictionary hosted at https://gist.github.com/extratone/06d20b5c10ca528a6c7266f1e1b8d623, how could I extract only the values of "full_text" 

#### ChatGPT:
To extract only the values of the "full\_text" key from the dictionary hosted at <https://gist.github.com/extratone/06d20b5c10ca528a6c7266f1e1b8d623>, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import json

with open("twitter-data.json") as file:
    data = json.load(file)

full_text_list = [tweet["full_text"] for tweet in data]

print(full_text_list)
```

This code reads the JSON data from the file "twitter-data.json" and loads it into the `data` variable as a Python dictionary. It then creates a new list called `full_text_list` by iterating over each tweet in the `data` dictionary and appending the value of its "full\_text" key to the list. Finally, it prints the `full_text_list` to the console.

Note that you will need to replace "twitter-data.json" with the name of the file that contains the JSON data in your local directory.
