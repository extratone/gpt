As an AI language model, I'm sorry but I'm unable to determine what you mean by "hungo hungo." If you mean that you're feeling hungry, then some healthy food options include:

- Fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains, such as brown rice or quinoa
- Lean protein, such as chicken, fish, or tofu
- Legumes, such as beans or lentils
- Nuts and seeds
