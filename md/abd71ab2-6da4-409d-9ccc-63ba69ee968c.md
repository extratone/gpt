# Mastodon Clients: Best Onboarding

#### You:
Which Mastodon client/"app" on iOS/iPadOS has the best rated new user onboarding experience?

#### ChatGPT:
As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or app ratings. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there were several popular Mastodon clients available for iOS/iPadOS. Keep in mind that ratings and user preferences may change over time. Here are a few well-regarded Mastodon clients for iOS/iPadOS:

1. Amaroq: Amaroq has been widely praised for its user-friendly interface and smooth onboarding experience. It offers a clean and intuitive design, making it easier for new users to navigate and understand Mastodon's features.

2. Toot! by toot.cafe: Toot! is another popular Mastodon client that has received positive feedback for its user onboarding process. It offers a straightforward setup process and provides clear explanations for new users to understand Mastodon's decentralized social network.

3. Mast: Mast is a Mastodon client with a minimalistic design and a focus on providing a smooth onboarding experience. It offers a step-by-step guide for new users, helping them set up their Mastodon accounts quickly.

These are just a few examples, and there might be other Mastodon clients available on the App Store that provide excellent onboarding experiences. I recommend checking the App Store and reading user reviews for the latest information on app ratings and new user onboarding experiences.
