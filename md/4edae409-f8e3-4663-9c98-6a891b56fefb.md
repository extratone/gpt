Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-*Extratone* culture podcast called [*Drycast*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk) with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 - a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, I thought we'd found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our *paid* Teamspeak server. If I were still podcasting, Discord's [just-released server video feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video) would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams.

According to [a poll I ran on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20), 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord's existence. This is not surprising considering what every Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite links through an application that's about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one's web browser.) Those of us that remember [IRC](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185), Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.

Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. "What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would use," said CEO Jason Citron in [an interview with CNBC](https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA). Technically in terms of these details, Discord *has no competition*. Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video - especially considering [Discord Go Live](https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel), its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen share this way, which is an essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.

"Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior tool," says [esports team Ardent United](https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824). "Discord has voice channels, which allows us to easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation extremely simple." It's not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized cloud platform Sia also [moved their community](https://blog.sia.tech/sia-is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6) to Discord:

> Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like [Reactiflux](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html) and [Unreal Slackers](https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612). It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and really great moderation and spam filtering features.

Slack is [often praised](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack) for its integrations, but it shares support with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/) - a dedicated web integration service which more or less integrates them equally.

> Slack works with [a long list of tools](https://slack.com/integrations), including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens of others. If you're looking for an integration that isn't immediately obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates integrations between other apps and services, without you having to know any code to make it happen.

For sharing detailed post embeds, there's also [Discohook](https://discohook.org/), which I just discovered. Productivity company Chanty's blog wrote perhaps [the most in-depth comparison](https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack) of the two services (emphasis theirs):

> At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are **team chat apps** with a similar interface. Both apps have **team communication organized** in channels. The biggest difference between the two is their **target audience**, and of course, their **specific features**.

Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services' respective target audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization like *Extratone*, Discord's features-for-price ratio is simply too rich to pass up.

Why don't Americans trust Telegram?

#### ChatGPT:
The level of trust or mistrust towards Telegram in the United States, or any other country, can vary among individuals and is influenced by several factors. While it is difficult to generalize the sentiments of an entire population, there are a few reasons why some Americans might express caution or concerns about Telegram:

1. Encryption and Privacy: Telegram is known for its strong encryption protocols, which some individuals might view as a potential challenge for law enforcement agencies in investigating criminal activities. This concern arises due to Telegram's focus on privacy and its end-to-end encryption, which can make it difficult for third parties to access user data.

2. Perception of Being a Haven for Illicit Activities: Telegram has gained popularity in certain circles due to its encrypted communication features, which has led to concerns about its potential misuse by individuals involved in illegal activities, such as cybercrime, terrorism, or distribution of illicit content. Although Telegram takes measures to combat such activities, the perception might persist.

3. Limited Transparency and Regulatory Compliance: Telegram's company structure and communication policies have been criticized for being relatively opaque compared to other platforms. Some individuals may prefer platforms with more transparent policies and stronger regulatory compliance.

It's important to note that these concerns are not exclusive to Telegram and can be applied to other messaging platforms as well. Trust in any messaging app can vary based on individual perceptions, experiences, and prevailing narratives.

Why are Americans so afraid of China?

#### ChatGPT:
It is not accurate to say that all Americans are afraid of China. Views and perceptions about China can vary among individuals, influenced by a range of factors such as personal experiences, cultural influences, geopolitical dynamics, and media portrayals. It is important to recognize that public sentiment towards China is diverse and complex, and not everyone in the United States holds the same perspective.

However, it is true that there are certain concerns and apprehensions held by some Americans about China. Some of the reasons behind these concerns include:

1. Economic Competition: China's rapid economic growth and its role as a global manufacturing hub have led to concerns about job losses and economic competitiveness in certain industries. Some Americans worry about the impact of China's economic policies, such as trade practices and intellectual property rights enforcement, on their own economy.

2. Human Rights and Democracy: China's human rights record, including issues related to freedom of expression, religious freedom, and treatment of ethnic minorities, has been a subject of criticism. Americans who prioritize human rights and democratic values may express concerns about China's actions and policies in these areas.

3. Geopolitical Tensions: China's rise as a global power has led to increased competition and strategic tensions with the United States on various fronts, including trade, technology, military influence, and regional disputes. These tensions can contribute to a sense of unease or caution among some Americans about China's intentions and geopolitical ambitions.

It is important to note that these concerns are not universal or representative of all Americans. People's opinions and attitudes toward China can differ significantly, and it is essential to consider a range of perspectives when discussing such complex geopolitical dynamics.

How does privatized electricity infrastructure work in the US? 

#### ChatGPT:
In the United States, the electricity infrastructure can vary depending on the specific region and state. While some areas have publicly owned or cooperative electric utilities, others have privatized electricity infrastructure. In general, privatized electricity infrastructure involves the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the generation, transmission, and distribution systems by private companies. Here's a brief overview of how it typically works:

1. Generation: Private companies, known as power generators, own and operate power plants that produce electricity. These power plants can use various energy sources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewable sources (like wind or solar), or a combination of these. The generated electricity is then sold to utilities or directly to customers.

2. Transmission: The electricity generated at power plants is transmitted over long distances through a network of high-voltage transmission lines. Private companies, known as transmission system operators (TSOs), own and maintain this infrastructure. TSOs ensure the reliable and efficient transmission of electricity from the generation sources to the distribution systems.

3. Distribution: Private electric utilities or distribution companies are responsible for the distribution of electricity to end-users, such as residential, commercial, and industrial customers. These companies own and operate the local distribution networks, including power lines, transformers, substations, and meters. They deliver electricity from the transmission system to individual customers' premises.

4. Retail Market: In some deregulated or restructured electricity markets, customers have the option to choose their electricity supplier. Private retail electricity providers compete to offer electricity plans, pricing options, and services directly to customers. Customers can select the supplier that best meets their needs and may have the flexibility to switch suppliers if desired.

It's important to note that the specific regulations, market structures, and ownership models can vary across states and regions. Some areas may have a vertically integrated model where a single company handles generation, transmission, and distribution, while others have separate entities for each segment. The oversight and regulation of the electricity industry are typically carried out by state-level public utility commissions or regulatory bodies to ensure fair practices, reliability, and consumer protection.
