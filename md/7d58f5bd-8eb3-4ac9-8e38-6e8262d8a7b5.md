Between $12,000 and $16,000, less than 10 years old, hatchback or compact sedan with all wheel drive and a reliable reputation

#### ChatGPT:
Based on your criteria of a hatchback or compact sedan with all-wheel drive, a reliable reputation, and a budget between $12,000 and $16,000, one option you could consider is the Subaru Impreza. The Impreza is known for its all-wheel drive capability and reliability. It offers a practical hatchback variant and is available as a compact sedan as well. With your budget, you should be able to find a slightly used Subaru Impreza within the desired age range.

Additionally, you may also explore other models like the Mazda3 or the Honda Fit. While they don't come standard with all-wheel drive, they are well-regarded for their reliability, compact size, and versatility. Keep in mind that finding a specific used car within these parameters can vary based on availability and local market conditions. It's always a good idea to thoroughly research and inspect any used car before making a purchase.
