# Mounting a file system.

#### You:
please explain this terminal command:
mount -t real "$(cat /proc/ish/documents)/themes" .

#### ChatGPT:
This terminal command has several parts:

1. `mount`: This is a command in Linux/Unix operating systems that allows a file system to be attached to a directory in the file system hierarchy.

2. `-t real`: This option specifies the type of file system to be mounted. In this case, it is using a file system type called "real".

3. `$(cat /proc/ish/documents)/themes`: This part of the command uses a subshell to run the `cat` command on a file called "documents" in the "/proc/ish" directory. The output of this command is then used as part of the mount command as the location of the file system to be mounted. Specifically, it is mounting a directory called "themes" that is located within the directory specified by the output of the `cat` command.

4. `.`: This specifies the location on the local file system where the "themes" directory will be mounted.

So, in summary, this command is mounting a file system located in a directory specified by the output of a `cat` command, using the "real" file system type, and mounting it to a directory called "themes" in the current directory.
