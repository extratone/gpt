# Reviewing inRoute for The Psalms

#### You:
I'm working on an app review for my blog about a navigation app for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS called inRoute. I was hoping we could start a conversation in which I send you my current drafts and ask you to analyze them in various ways.

#### ChatGPT:
Of course, I'd be happy to help you analyze your drafts for your app review. Please go ahead and share your draft, and let me know what specific aspects or analysis you'd like assistance with.

Here is the current text body:

inRoute Review

A one-of-a-kind navigation experience for recreational driving enthusiasts and commuters, alike.


For my whole adult life, driving recreationally has been the one activity which has consistently brought me joy. Indeed, I have covered thousands and thousands of miles - mostly throughout my home state, Missouri - since first acquiring my license some 15 years ago. Though I was making less than $8 an hour at a tool store, I spent virtually all of it on what little fuel my NB Miata consumed across 15,000 of these in just our first summer together. I was 19 and - though I thought I'd been exposed to a great breadth of car culture - I did not realize just how much of it has absolutely nothing to do with actually driving.

There are plenty of very good reasons for this, of course - depreciation, danger, etc. - but in the decade since I'd owned that car[1], I've nursed a hypothesis that feels more original than I'd like it to: I'm not sure local "fast boys" actually know where to go to enjoy their automobiles. Having just gotten back on the road for the first time in several years, this notion has become especially poignant thanks to frequent observations made in just the past eight or nine weeks. I've seen far too much fast boy behavior in completely inappropriate locales. (Full-throttle Hellcat acceleration downtown on a busy weekend evening, for instance.)

However, in tandem with these, I have also observed - having returned to the routes I would have once been able to prescribe more or less verbally in place of these contexts - that all have become more risk-intensive settings in which to drive quickly. Route K between The Big Burr Oak and Rock Bridge High School - where I once spent my gas station lunch breaks shuffling my dear, departed XJR (https://www.instagram.com/p/BKdP2upAqmn) through wooded, empty bends - has now been stricken with significantly greater traffic (motorists and otherwise,) and blessed with roundabouts (https://beheard.como.gov/route-k-roundabout), as has Route WW East of US 63. The exact stretch of Missouri Route 179 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Route_179) on which Myke's Evo X made me yell cartoonishly (https://davidblue.wtf/evo) featured an actual pedestrian walking up a blind hill the first time I revisited last summer.

The simple explanation is that the mid-Missouri area surrounding Columbia which I will probably occupy until after my casket drops has expanded dramatically in population. In so many ways, I have struggled with little success to adapt to this fact, recently, to the misfortune of those around me, but in this crucial aspect of driving as recreation, I have found some hope in the form of digital tools. Rekindling my interest in manifesting a multi-use social service for driving enthusiasts have been RoadStr (https://app.roadstr.io/u/64dc60ffd1fd7c0011011807) and MyRoute (https://www.myrouteapp.com/profile/home/1269471) - both of which allow routes to be shared and published. They also both have CarPlay-enabled iOS apps, though I'm afraid neither represent a suitable replacement when one need actually navigate.


The most essential application that's enabled me to explore and publish routes to these services has been inRoute (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inroute-intelligent-routing/id703796787), which appears on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS via Catalyst (https://inroute.com/inroute-for-mac). Its CarPlay integration (https://inroute.com/inroute-guide-carplay) manages to be perhaps the most mature such experience I've encountered from a third-party app.

[1]: Which, it's perhaps relevant to note, is for driving recreationally far more than most, if that's not obvious.


#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for sharing your draft. It's a detailed and personal introduction to your experience with recreational driving, which sets the stage for your review of inRoute. Here are some observations and suggestions:

1. **Introduction:** The introduction is engaging, highlighting your passion for recreational driving. It could benefit from a concise summary of what inRoute is and how it fits into your driving experience. This will give readers a clear idea of what to expect from the review.

2. **Personal Experience:** Your personal anecdotes are valuable, but try to connect them more explicitly to the navigation app. For example, mention instances where you used or could have used inRoute during your drives.

3. **Paragraph Structure:** Consider breaking down some of the longer paragraphs into shorter ones. This will make the text easier to read and navigate on a digital platform.

4. **Hyperlinks:** While providing links to your Instagram and other websites is informative, ensure that these links are relevant to the review or add them in a footnote if they're more for personal reference.

5. **Comparison:** It would be helpful to provide a brief comparison with other navigation apps you might have used in the past. This could give readers context about what makes inRoute unique.

6. **Conclusion:** Your draft doesn't seem to have a clear conclusion or summary of your thoughts on inRoute. Consider summarizing your main points and providing a clear recommendation or insight about the app.

Feel free to make revisions based on these suggestions, and if you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please let me know!


#### You:
Re: 4, could you remember from now on that I think hyperlinks are very important and try to include them liberally.

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly, I'll keep that in mind, and I'll include hyperlinks as needed in our discussions. If you have any specific hyperlinks you'd like to include in your text or if you want to add them to the current draft, please let me know, and I'll assist accordingly.


#### You:
Actually, I should include some of the general notes I have so far:

- The simple fact that inRoute is *commandable* is perhaps its single most relentlessly extraordinary quality, which reflects quite pitifully on the rest of the offerings who claim to be navigation apps. This goes beyond just driving enthusiast users like me - the vast majority of the conversations I've had with regular users about navigation apps have touched on the need for recallable, specifiable, reliable regular routes.
- By far and away the most daily-usable of the "advanced" navigation category I've ever encountered. As in, by far the fewest compromises as one's primary navigation app.
- When you live, work, and generally spend time between several locations across complex systems of roads subject to all kinds of (mostly chronologically-controlled) variables, inRoute can become an invaluable life planner.

#### ChatGPT:
These are excellent notes that highlight some key strengths of inRoute. When incorporating them into your review, you can expand on each point to provide a comprehensive analysis. Here's how you can integrate these notes into your draft:

1. **Commandable Experience:** In your review, emphasize how inRoute stands out due to its commandable nature. Explain how this sets it apart from other navigation apps and why it's a valuable feature, not just for driving enthusiasts but for all users who require reliable routes.

2. **Daily Usability:** Discuss in more detail how inRoute excels in daily usability within the "advanced" navigation app category. Explain the practical benefits it offers, making it suitable as a primary navigation app. Mention specific features or functionalities that contribute to this usability.

3. **Life Planner:** Elaborate on how inRoute can serve as a valuable life planner, especially for users who navigate complex road systems across multiple locations. Provide examples or scenarios where inRoute's capabilities help users manage their daily routines effectively.

By expanding on these points in your review, you'll provide readers with a well-rounded understanding of why inRoute is a standout navigation app. If you need further assistance with specific sections or any other aspect of your review, please feel free to ask.


#### You:
To your knowledge, has anyone/any publication ever attempted to establish some a sort of formal editorial framework for longform-ish reviews of iOS/iPadOS applications?

#### ChatGPT:
As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there wasn't a widely recognized formal editorial framework specifically designed for long-form reviews of iOS/iPadOS applications. However, it's possible that developments or initiatives in this area have emerged since then.

Review formats and guidelines often vary between individual bloggers, tech publications, and app review websites. They typically focus on aspects such as user interface, features, performance, pros, and cons. If you're looking for guidance on creating a structured framework for long-form app reviews, you might consider examining successful reviews from reputable tech websites and adapting their formats to suit your style and preferences.

Additionally, you could explore any recent developments in the field of app review journalism or blogging that may have introduced new frameworks or standards. It's always a good idea to stay current with trends and best practices in the field to create high-quality, informative reviews.


#### You:
If possible, I would now like to send you the full body text of the few app reviews I've written over the past 5-7 years or so with the eventual goal of asking you if you can identify commonalities in structure between them. I think I will have to send them one at a time as individual messages, in order from most recent to least.

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly, you can send them one at a time, starting with the most recent one. Once you've shared the text of each review, I'll analyze them individually and then provide insights into commonalities in their structures. Please go ahead and send the text of your most recent app review when you're ready.


#### You:
First, my review of Mastodon's own native iOS app:

Indeed, **[it is here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974)**. Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took me to write the [third-party Mastodon iOS app showcase](https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-apps) just before this item in *The Psalms*’ feed. If you’re new to this conversation, perhaps it’d be best to start in February of this year, with [Eugen’s announcement of the “official” Mastodon app’s development](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/) on the official Mastodon blog. “We need an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform,” argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating “the lack of an app that carries \[Mastodon’s\] name in the app stores trips up newcomers.” My first thought regarding the idea of an app *Specialized* in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who already call Mastodon our home. However, as a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mastodon) supporter of the Mastodon Project, I’ve had the privilege of testing the final result for the past five weeks, and I can tell ya… It is so much more than that.

## Onboarding

I’d like to offer the [demo video](https://youtu.be/bD8GQvNrE7E) embedded above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to declare it **the best all-around social network onboarding process currently available**. Having very recently slugged through the official Twitter app’s equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within this app are unbelievably exceptional.

![Onboarding in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/P5oxTAg9.png)

First, we’re presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,) organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I’ve failed to “sell” Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of confusion and I can’t imagine a better means of addressing it than the tool offered by this app. It’s beautiful and fast in a way previous utilities - like [instances.social](https://instances.social) - cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we’ve chosen a server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly readable document containing the “ground rules” set by its administrators. In my experience, these rules tend to be notably **easy-to-understand** and **not open to interpretation**, as if they were written primarily in the interest of community wellness rather than to construct a defense from legal action.

After we’ve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we’ve chosen, it’s on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens of the social web have become accustomed - profile picture, username, email address, and password - but notably without the [inexplicable errors](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus) exhibited for years in Big Social’s equivalent functions. Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS’ implementation of the operating system's intra-app linking function (with the syntax `mastodon://`,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed *within the Mastodon app* instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This integration should not be remarkable, but - in the context of iOS development as it stands in 2021 - it most certainly is.

After confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app’s “Find people to follow” function, which is informed by "a mix of most followed accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post primarily in your language," as [Eugen explained](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440) in response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online - especially those who post the most. That's the whole bit! If you need "proof," [here is the finished result](https://mastodon.online/@keys), but obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It's a cliché, yes, but seriously... What do you have to lose?)

## Advantages

One of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party offerings has been the ability to edit one's profile information from within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a manner that puts Big Social's equivalents to shame. The ability to vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for instance, reflects insight only gained by *actually using these features*. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a Mastodon poll, for what that's worth.

![Polling in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/NKHk8e1W.png)

### Shortcuts

As of this writing, Mastodon for  iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support by way of a single action, entitled "Post on Mastodon." Mostly in the interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts around this action on RoutineHub:

1. "**[Mastodon Share](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9776/)**" - a text-only Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.

2. "**[Mastgur](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9781/)**" - a more complicated Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the current Mastodon for iOS action's lack of multimedia support.

![Siri Shortcuts for Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/H212I22P.png)

Mastodon friend Emma's [customization of the latter](https://mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com/@emma/106656610574981709) is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these (and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.

## Challenges

As of this writing, coverage of the app’s release amounted only to [a single news item from ](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches)*[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches)*[’s Adi Robinson](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches), which notes the omission of local/federated “firehose” timeline views out of a desire to “reduce the potential for conflict with Apple.” (see: the Inc.’s [blatantly inconsistent enforcement](https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone) of its store policies in the past few months.) As a Mastodon user who *does* occasionally engage with my local and federated timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of third-party apps on iOS which *do* support said views and the app’s explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience disagrees with Eugen’s description of these timelines as a suboptimal means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I’ve found \~70-80% of [the 600+ accounts I follow](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv), there. (Though it should be noted that I *do not* represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or behavior.)

Though the onboarding process’ people to follow finder is pretty darn stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I’m sure this would be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I am 100% positive these omissions from the *initial release* version of this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the greater concept of Federation.

![Composition Details in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/7UTf6Qyx.png)

Naturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in hashtag iOS on the Fediverse: [no multiple account support](https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223)?! Perhaps you’ve already written me off as a mindless devotee, but - especially after exploring [the whole breadth of Mastodon apps available on iOS](https://github.com/extratone/mastodon-ios-apps) (all of which support multiple accounts) - the significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested, I personally feel *pretty well covered* when it comes to checking my (embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It’d be one thing if longtime users/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us, but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any other social media protocol. To decry this app - which was explicitly designed from the very beginning for new users - for skipping a function offered by *more than a dozen alternatives* is patently absurd. If you’ve got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly, order them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free, dependable [Amaroq](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amaroq-for-mastodon/id1214116200), and save Mastodon’s new app for your main.

## Delights

The “relentless originality” I spoke of in my *third-party* showcase is no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette is a welcome departure from Tootsuite’s (the mother web application,) while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed throughout the app is adorable, as you’ve seen, and its bespoke audio player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.

![Mastodon for iOS Audio Player](https://i.snap.as/IRzEOzXl.png)

Custom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party apps, so the project-sourced app’s inclusion of the iconic Mastodon “boop” is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of substance to the whole experience.

Though quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon app’s inclusion of **Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts** provoked a moment of true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my ‘*[iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard](https://github.com/extrakeys)* project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially “our” Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us “full keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.” (As of this writing, the award is just a “trophy.”)

![Mastodon for iPhone - Universal Clacker Award](https://i.snap.as/H7NjCvd7.png)

An important consideration to inform the perspective through which we analyze such an app, I’d argue, is that **this app could have been very bad**. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking services/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well suggest it *should* have been bad. Had it been just mediocre, half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I’m sure I would still have paused everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an “objectively” excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of iPhone user *not* finding it refreshing in some way.

I would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its craftsmanship, *but* they wouldn’t have exhausted reasons to use it. From the very first beta release I installed to the first release version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has *never* crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter’s official iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself. Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions only be performed with your app in focus - even when it surely makes no difference to your ad tech mechanism - and you have Mastodon’s single action, “Show When Run” toggle included.

I’m not sure what I expected from an “official” Mastodon app upon first reading that winter blog post, but what I’ve been delivered is quite a gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was invested in this app

Second, my much older review of Zalgo Generator for iOS:

A warning siren sounds louder still for the current state of the *Digital Divide* than the profoundly ignorant spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg’s drooling, ghoulish interrogators last year from the digital hole of none other than [W3School’s trusty web validator](https://validator.w3.org), which would surely be rated as the Most Anxious Being in History if it were to acquire sentience. The CSS file this very webpage referenced returned no fewer than *[350 syntax errors](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.extratone.com&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)* at the time of this writing; **[Facebook dot com’s login page](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)** set off only 55. For going on a *decade*, now, the web has continued to expand into a grotesque, diseased mass.

Yet another piece of software I have notably been using for 10 years: the infamous [eemo.net](http://www.eeemo.net/) Zalgo web text fucker. Ideally, I’d now proceed to embed some special examples of the hedonistic online text vandalism which the tool enabled me to inflict widely throughout my adolescence. However - as you can probably imagine - *searching* for these criminally-broken posts using standard tools provided by the services that have hosted them is virtually futile. In retrospect, I do not recall ever eliciting any acknowledgment of Zalgo’s effects, yet I’m positive that at least the *majority* of my victims set eyes upon the mess at some point - their silence is actually more entertaining than not, I think. Despite my extensive use of the format, I made a point to maintain my total ignorance about the origin of “[Zalgo](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo)” for the past decade - only spoiling it **in the name of good journalism** for your sake and this review.

> On forums and image boards, scrambled text began being associated with Zalgo with phrases like "he comes" and "he waits behind the wall." David Higgins revealed that the text is an ~abuse~ of a Unicode feature that enables the user to combine multiple superscript and subscript characters into a vertical line. 

By bizarre coincidence or some ridiculously obscure, intractable common cultural thread (which would probably take a lifetime to successfully trace,) [Dave Higgins](https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins) and I were *already mutuals* on Mastodon before I had any idea his name was at all associated with Zalgo. More bizarre still: Dave must’ve been watching his timeline at the exact moment when I [posted the above quote](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102564857843257870) mentioning him.

<iframe src="https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins/102565065494333224/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="300" height="250" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Unfortunately, it seems his blog has moved, killing the hyperlink citation in one of the two relevant search engine results for “zalgo”: [its *Know Your Meme* page](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo). [Searching the same term](https://davidjhiggins.wordpress.com/?s=zalgo) on his new WordPress blog yields *absolutely nothing*, so perhaps “I deny everything” was a more sincere response than one expected. A thread on *Stack Overflow* entitled [“How does Zalgo text work?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work) explains the fuckery in more detail than I ever could:

> You can easily construct a character sequence, consisting of a base character and “combining above” marks, of any length, to reach any desired visual height, assuming that the rendering software conforms to the Unicode rendering model. 

There is something artistic about destroyed text like this - something that's more than just edgy chaos. I believe in "[surreal memes](https://mashable.com/article/surreal-memes/)" that can break Facebook and Twitter posts. I believe in Zalgo, and I believe you need [Zalgo Generator for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1178473555) on your phone *right now*.

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for sharing your review of the Zalgo Generator for iOS. Let's analyze the structure of this older review:

1. **Introduction:** The review begins with a thought-provoking statement about the state of the digital world and the complexity of web design. This introduction sets a tone of reflection and critique.

2. **Background:** You provide some context about the software you're reviewing, highlighting its long history of use and its association with text manipulation on the web.

3. **Personal Experience:** Your review includes personal anecdotes and experiences with the software, emphasizing your use of it for a decade and the impact it had on your online interactions.

4. **Quotations and References:** You incorporate quotations from sources like Know Your Meme and Stack Overflow to add depth and background information, demonstrating thorough research.

5. **Recommendation:** You conclude the review by strongly recommending the Zalgo Generator for iOS, emphasizing its artistic potential and unique qualities.

Third, a still older review of Mastonaut - a third-party Mastodon client for macOS - which I originally published in my online magazine:

Since you last heard from us, the federated social network [Mastodon](https://extratone.com/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated-social-network) has scaled tremendously in usership and steadily grown technologically into an incredibly robust and dynamic platform. Perhaps inevitably, Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source developers have continued to embarrass the living fuck out of Twitter's team - at least for those who've continued to pay attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of aspiration has yet to perish.) 

I planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS development by watching closely for the first "premium" Mastodon clients to come out, which I suspected (quite correctly) would carry the first substantial risk-taking on the part of plucky social apps to be seen on the goddamned App Store in what felt like eternity. Unfortunately, I've ended up far too deep in screenshots/insights from **[Toot!](http://bit.ly/tootios)** and **[Mast](http://bit.ly/mastios)**, creating a bit of an overwhelming obstacle in comparing and/or reviewing the two without sinking deep in my regular, pretentious hole. (Though both of them are absolutely gorgeous, fascinating, and impressive projects which you should invest in and follow if you're interested in the future of federated social whatsoever.)

**That said**... I'd like only to mention and [briefly demonstrate](https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc) the first premium *desktop* Mastodon client, ***[Mastonaut](http://bit.ly/mastonaut)***, which I had the privilege of experiencing momentarily last night.

![Mastonaut Add Instance](https://i.snap.as/hFeyH28.png)

In the interest of brevity (and because I was unable to continue fucking around for any length of time,) I'll just list some observations:

* The entire GUI experience is distinctly uncluttered (or perhaps *barren*, depending on your subjective desires from this sort of thing,) but duplicates dearest [TweetBot](https://extratone.com/tweetbot-5-ios-review-twitter-client)'s functionality impressively well considering its age as an independently-developed product.
* Keyboard shortcuts! Fuck me, God.
* I love the live-updated instance directory search (above) as a second landing for first-time users.
* Though I did actually have to repeat the first-time login process after freezing and subsequently force-quitting Mastonaut, I think you'll probably place the blame on my own immediate and inpatient window management mania considering how smoothly it all went the second time around.

To be honest, [Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1091189122?mt=12), [Spark](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641?mt=12), and recent other beautiful Mac applications beckon me to buy or hack myself into MacOS again. If I have time in the near future, I'll show you why.

Fourth is my still older review of Tweetbot 5 for iOS, which I'm going to have to split up in several parts. Here's part one:

On Win­dows XP bal­lot day, I spent *my* beat­nik-ass time mar­veling at the (seem­ing­ly) abrupt avail­abil­i­ty of some gen­uine­ly inno­v­a­tive social apps on the Apple App Store for the first time since iOS 7(?) Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware *espe­cial­ly* because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.)

That said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s [lat­est iter­a­tion](https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs/) may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the [ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tweetbot/) I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but [jus­ti­fied, sortof](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17274828/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth)) treat­ment of its once [aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools](https://mashable.com/2009/05/02/twitter-iphone-apps/#S_O.z..2mqqJ), yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it *nev­er* would’ve occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble *and* bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: [the Native Fuck, itself](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8), which has also under­gone [sig­nif­i­cant cos­met­ic surgery](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling/276541/), recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the *one fuck­ing but­ton* that’s giv­en the app a usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over its mobile web-based low-rent clone.

“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner and “floats” as users scroll down their time­line. That means the but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood strikes.”

Yeah okay, *Matt*.

#### ChatGPT:
I'll need to split this review into multiple parts due to its length. Here's part two:

First, **a per­son­al obser­va­tion:** I’ve been tak­ing many of my notes late­ly on Twit­ter’s own ded­i­cat­ed [Mac app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id1482454543?mt=12), which has not been sub­ject to any major updates *in at least five years.* **Tweet­bot is better.**

![Tweetbot 5 for iOS](https://i.snap.as/QSdd5po.png)

I should also note that I am cur­rent­ly using Tweet­bot 5 (iOS) on an iPhone SE, 9to5Mac does not dis­close review tech hard­ware (to my knowl­edge,) and I’ll be focus­ing exclu­sive­ly on its core fea­tures and design *expe­ri­ence* rather than inno­va­tions and alter­ations since v4. Nota bene that Tap­bots is known for its accu­rate simul­tane­ity when it comes to update fea­tures across devices and its strong engage­ment with the Tweet­bot com­mu­ni­ty, so my cur­rent expe­ri­ence with the iOS app *should* remain rel­e­vant to any oth­er plat­form.

From my iPhone SE’s start-up screen, I tried launch­ing both native Twit­ter and Tweet­bot sim­ul­ta­ne­ous­ly, both on Wifi and cel­lu­lar (LTE) con­nec­tions. The time it took for each to boot and refresh the home feed was **astound­ing­ly sim­i­lar,** so I wasn’t sur­prised to find that both per­formed *iden­ti­cal­ly* in app func­tion­al­i­ty speed. This dif­fer­ence in per­ceived speed from ver­sion 4 was quite start, actu­al­ly, and it’s a major improve­ment.

The feed stream itself remains a delight in Tweet­bot 5. Twit­ter for iOS is equal­ly impres­sive for how well it han­dles the feed, but its *tight* inte­gra­tion with the com­pa­ny’s web prod­uct feels heav­i­er than Tap­bots’ app and even exhibits a pesky ten­den­cy to forcibly refresh the page. Tweet­bot, by con­trast, nev­er\* \*jerks or sur­pris­es while open.

The iOS client *still* uses Twit­ter’s own (much dis­cussed, *much* mis­un­der­stood) APIs for every­thing, and the pro­found changes to its basic func­tion­al­i­ty have final­ly become enough to drive me to invest the time nec­es­sary to reclaim the abil­i­ty to com­pose tweets from the comfort of [a news­read­er](https://bilge.world/amp/2020/09/republicofnews).

Let’s talk about com­po­si­tion in Tweet­bot 5 for iOS. Above, I com­mend­ed the app’s scrollable com­pose but­ton (aka the com­pose but­ton was “float­ed”) for its poten­tial usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over the native app’s equiv­a­lent. For­get that! **The com­pose but­ton has been dis­patched alto­geth­er**, tak­en on by Apple’s lazy bot­tom nav­i­ga­tion par­a­digm and Tweetbot’s design team took this oppor­tu­ni­ty to go entire­ly wild.

**Tweet­bot 5's Big Secret: There’s no longer a but­ton to com­pose tweets.**

**Explain**

It’s very very impor­tant to me that you under­stand this change. **You can com­pose tweets from any­where in the app, now.** Unlike most of the dis­joint­ed, com­pli­cat­ed and mal­func­tion­ing com­pose flows in Twit­ter’s cur­rent app, Tweet­bot has cho­sen not to spe­cial case or seg­ment the process of tweet­ing.

Sure, this sounds like the kind of rad­i­cal change that dri­ves users away, but it’s com­plete­ly **intu­itive.** Sim­ply:

1. **Tap** the but­ton to enter “com­pose mode.” (Or tap and hold for a very slight \[and very cool] ani­ma­tion of the but­ton become a [pen nib](https://i.snap.as/f9fEaX4.png)).

2. **Begin typ­ing** any­thing. What you see is *exact­ly* what you get.

3. **Tap the “X” but­ton** to dis­card the draft and can­cel the tweet.

4. **Tap the "Tweet" but­ton** (for­mer­ly the send but­ton) when you’re ready to send.

**That’s it.** When I say intu­itive, I mean that I was *fully* expect­ing to have to “

Twit­ter Sup­port is no [@Cher](http://twitter.com/cher), yeah, but it seems strange that less than a thou­sand of Twitter’s [more than 300 mil­lion month­ly users](http://bilge.world/media/birdearn.pdf) would both­er to engage with the announce­ment of a sig­nif­i­cant fun­da­men­tal change to its infra­struc­ture. Imag­ine if the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States was going to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only 1000 *total* Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, **get out and** [vote on my Twit­ter poll](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1062859883211620352), you fascist!

In my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile of lin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the [ear­li­est and ugli­est](https://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/17/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store/) ways to use Twit­ter ever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly, Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs, Twistori, and Twit­bin. These are just a few I picked up from a [10-year-old](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [*TechCrunch*](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [report](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) list­ing the top 21 Twit­ter appli­ca­tions by traf­fic.

I'll continue with part three of your review:

How many of these apps can you remem­ber? Even the true Twit­t­er elite must be hard-pressed to recall more than a third of these, at best. The point is, the mar­ket was once so sat­u­rat­ed with Twit­ter clients that the aver­age user had *no way* to main­tain com­pre­hen­sive, extend­ed knowl­edge of more than a frac­tion of them. As soon as you had a grip on the con­cept of tweet­ing, anoth­er shiny new Twit­ter app with a damn dis­rup­tion strate­gic might be born. I wish I had known about and had the resources to use any of these many third-par­ty Twit­ter clients back then, but that was before I real­ly cared about any­thing enough to engage in soft­ware media crit­i­cism and jour­nal­ism. Before I decid­ed to be a writer, I was a video game design and pro­gram­ming per­son — I was a [Soft­ware Devloper!](http://extratone.com/softdev) — but when my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege let me spend their mon­ey to learn what I was doing (with­out teach­ing me any­thing about it), I made the mis­take of try­ing to make mon­ey with [GFX](https://bilge.world/tag/gfx). For two years. Mean­while, I didn’t even make time for Reddit’s [chris­tian\[/tech\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/christian/) sub­red­dit, where I would’ve learned so much about mis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns, because of the dis­tract­ing litany of *decen­cy reforms* pop­ping up on /r/Atheism (I want to make sure you know that I’m being iron­ic, here.)

At the very least, I’ve been play­ing so much this month because I’m get­ting very very high rat­ings and beat­ing every single one of my [friends](https://extratone.com/the-tales-of-jayd-depew/) in terms of tak­ing ship count, and I’m no god­damn elite by any mean. Hope­ful­ly they won’t read this (if they do, they’ll find out how bad I am now!) The cru­cial lit­mus test of whether or not you’ll enjoy the game is whether or not you can do the pirate league, which you must play solo with a very poor­ly explained and *pooor­ly* exe­cut­ed new boss sys­tem, which is strange. Is any­one still play­ing? I can’t [tell](https://extratone.com/buy/). I hope so, it’s a fan­tas­tic game! Great music, which I wish I’d known before I spent years ignor­ing it in set­tings.

Its func­tion­al­i­ty and speed are now, quite sim­ply, *with­out peer,* which would not have been pos­si­ble with­out a strong, well-used com­mu­ni­ty of peo­ple will­ing to pay at least five bucks for a third-par­ty Twit­ter client — essen­tial­ly keep­ing third-par­ty Twit­ter clients in the busi­ness for the first time since Twit­ter itself sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly pushed them to mar­gin­al­i­ty, and I should prob­a­bly stop say­ing that all Twit­ter clients *except* Tweet­bot were ever *dis­rup­tive.*

Just as iPhone own­er­ship crept past the 1 bil­lion mark, Twit­ter decid­ed to [annihilate its third-par­ty com­mu­ni­ty](https://extratone.com/stop-always-being-updated/2018/08/on-a-mission-to-disrupt-an-entire-industry) and \[replace]\(<https://extratone.com/stop-always-being-updated/2018/08/when-the-employee-tells-me-that-we-are-the-beta-testers-and-that-theres-no>

Now, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing some­thing absurd like *The His­to­ry of Twit­ter Clients*, but the fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! *How­ev­er,* I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: **Twit­terif­ic** and **Tweet­bot**, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was *so bonkers* that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.

It was *fast*, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come back around to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is *daft* when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged *plugged-in-ness*, if you will.

Tweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to explore Twit­ter than any oth­er third par­ty client, but it can’t do the live thing. (Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion if you’re so inclined, though.) All I’m try­ing to say is, **there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­ter app** — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now *that* is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! And it did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace *some* use of its own prop­er­ties.

How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Fry tweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream.

If you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all acknowl­edge that **this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS**. The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has [made clear this year](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html) that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est [Tweet­Deck](https://youtu.be/EHDOQVAQzec), which they in fact *absorbed*. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” [accord­ing to *TechCrunch*](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients/). I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that [Echophon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/echofon-for-twitter/id286756410?mt=8), [Tweet­Cast­er](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetcaster-for-twitter/id420792544) or [Twit­ter­rif­ic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-tweet-your-way/id580311103) would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly *still work*, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they *[lit­er­al­ly built it](https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/)*. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­time thus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with [Talon](http://klinkerapps.com/talon-overview/) and [Tweet­ings](https://www.tweetings.net/apps/) — in a [plea for con­tin­ued access](http://apps-of-a-feather.com/) to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around the world.

sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but [I’ve been wrong before](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/712292559058444288). (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is [still around some­how](https://lookbook.nu/mom).) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit­ter app still [looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble](https://www.cultofmac.com/246067/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad/). When Tap­bots [released Tweet­bot 3](https://mashable.com/2013/10/24/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review/#SDbMxlCvFPqx), every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble user.

This is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing [dig­i­tal media](http://extratone.com/freq) — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot *user* as I am an idiot *read­er*. *Read­abil­i­ty* is to *Usabil­i­ty*, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I *could* do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’m capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in *Acces­si­bil­i­ty*, but Twit­ter always appears to [detest the sub­ject](https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?zd=1&amp;zi=zbzf6tkp), even while qui­et­ly putting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s *not* because it’s an expen­sive one at all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can *def­i­nite­ly* fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)

I would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing **Lists** — a sub­ject which I’ve already [Tweet­ed](https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176) and [writ­ten](http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/) about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and *wouldn’t it be such a shame* to not get your money’s worth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.

Tweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps [my bias towards Twit­ter lists](http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/) could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a [Fol­low­ing count](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/following) of over 5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time [Tweet­Bot 4 was released](https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9432291/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available) in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screens and was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.

**Review of Tweetbot 5 for iOS**

In the world of social media, where Twitter reigns supreme, finding the perfect client to navigate the platform can be an ongoing quest. Enter Tweetbot 5, the latest iteration of a beloved third-party Twitter client. As someone who appreciates innovative software and values a unique user experience, I felt compelled to delve into what Tweetbot 5 has to offer.

*Initial Impressions and App Landscape*

On Windows XP ballot day, I couldn't help but marvel at the seemingly abrupt availability of genuinely innovative social apps on the Apple App Store. It had been a while since we'd seen such innovation since the days of iOS 7. While some may view a sneak peek, NDA-violating app review as trivial, I believe discussing software, especially when it's something as widely used as Twitter, is crucial. After all, these apps and the companies behind them have the potential to shape the digital world.

Tweetbot's latest iteration immediately caught my attention, justifying the existence of its dedicated subreddit. I've had my fair share of complaints about Twitter's treatment of third-party clients, but I never expected Tweetbot to still be around, let alone preparing a release that would surpass its competition, including Twitter's own native app. It seemed like Tweetbot was poised to redefine stability and aesthetics in the Twitter client landscape.

*The Twitter App Ecosystem*

Twitter, once home to a diverse landscape of third-party clients and tools, had become increasingly hostile toward them, albeit for justifiable reasons. While I had accepted that the era of small, independent teams creating powerful Twitter apps had come to an end, Tweetbot's resurgence was a pleasant surprise. It even managed to outshine Twitter's native app, which had undergone significant cosmetic surgery.

Twitter's move of relocating the compose button to the bottom right-hand corner, following the trend of one-handed scrolling, seemed like an attempt to compete with third-party clients. However, it raised questions about usability and user experience.

*The Return of Third-Party Clients*

Twit­ter Sup­port, known for its less glamorous presence compared to celebrities like Cher, made a significant announcement about a new compose button. Yet, it seemed odd that such a fundamental change in Twitter's infrastructure garnered limited attention, considering the platform's massive user base. It highlighted the importance of user engagement, especially when changes affect the daily lives of millions.

In the glory days of Twitter, I used to spend my community college classes tweeting from my phone. Back then, there was a plethora of third-party clients available, each with its unique features and quirks. These clients filled the tech world with a cacophony of opinions and reviews.

*The Era of Third-Party Twitter Clients*

Now, let's delve into the cream of the crop: Twitterific and Tweetbot. I have a long-standing affection for Tweetbot. It was during my community college days that I first invested in Tweetbot 3 for my iPhone 4S, driven by the immense hype surrounding it. The app lived up to its reputation, offering speed and smoothness that even Twitter's native app couldn't match.

However, I must admit that the bloggers and YouTubers who claimed that premium apps like Tweetbot could entirely replace Twitter's native app were somewhat delusional. While Tweetbot addressed many issues, its Achilles' heel was notifications. The sporadic and unpredictable arrival of notifications disrupted the sense of being plugged in, similar to Chuck Klosterman's exploration of DVRing live sports.

*The Quest for Immediacy*

Live events like sports games hold our fascination not because of immediacy but because they represent moments where the entire spectrum of possibility is in play. Tweetbot, while superior in many aspects, couldn't replicate this live experience, thanks to Twitter's API limitations.

In essence, there's no reason to completely delete the Twitter app. You can hide it away in a folder while keeping its notifications active. This workflow might seem unconventional, but it worked for a long time, despite occasional discrepancies between Tweetbot's Mentions tab and the native app's instant notifications.

*The Last Competitive Third-Party Twitter App for iOS*

As of Tweetbot 5's release, it's safe to say that this might be the last competitive third-party Twitter app for iOS. Twitter, Inc. has made it clear that it prioritizes its own clients over maintaining the APIs required for others to receive push notifications. TweetDeck, once a popular alternative, was absorbed into Twitter's ecosystem.

Statistics showed a decline in users installing third-party Twitter clients, making it unlikely that apps like Echofon, TweetCaster, or Twitterific would remain available. Tweetbot and Twitterific, however, are different. They aren't just satellite products; they played a significant role in shaping Twitter's platform.

*The Challenge of Staying Relevant*

While many third-party clients have struggled to keep up with updates and remain compatible with newer iOS versions, Tweetbot and Twitterific have managed to stay afloat. Their longevity is remarkable, given the dynamic nature of the platform. Tweetbot's reliability and usability have been consistent since iOS 7.

*The User Experience and Accessibility*

It's frustrating to be treated like an idiotic user rather than an intelligent one. Some apps oversimplify user interactions, assuming that users can't handle more advanced features. In the case of the native Twitter app, its functions are geared towards the lowest common denominator, missing out on the potential for a richer user experience.

Accessibility should be a priority for social media platforms, and Twitter has faced criticism for its lack of investment in this area. Access should be equal for everyone, regardless of their abilities. Neglecting accessibility can undermine the professionalism of social media managers and limit their capabilities.

*The Power of Lists*

Lists, often overlooked but incredibly powerful, are a game-changer in managing Twitter. Both Tweetbot and Twitterific recognized the potential of lists and invested in their functionality. Lists offer the ability to filter and sort incoming content, allowing users to tailor their Twitter experience precisely. They provide a level of control and organization that can't be ignored.

*Tweeting with Tweetbot 5*

Returning to Tweetbot 5 in 2018 brought back a sense of familiarity and innovation. The app retains its charm with animation and audio notifications that seamlessly blend into the user experience. The ability to switch between color themes with a simple two-fingered swipe is a noteworthy addition, making it a compelling choice for users willing to invest $4.99 for a superior Twitter experience.

*Conclusion*

In conclusion, Tweetbot 5 stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of third-party Twitter clients. Despite the limitations imposed by Twitter, Inc., it manages to offer a robust and feature-rich alternative to the native app. The combination of familiarity, innovation, and user control makes it a top choice for Twitter enthusiasts.
