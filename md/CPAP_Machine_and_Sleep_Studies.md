Is it possible to acquire a CPAP machine without commissioning a sleep study?

#### ChatGPT:
In most countries, it is not possible to acquire a CPAP machine without a prescription from a medical professional, which typically requires a sleep study to diagnose sleep apnea. However, in some cases, a CPAP machine may be available for purchase without a prescription or sleep study, but it is not recommended as it can be dangerous to use a CPAP machine without proper medical supervision and diagnosis.
