# Tech Support Career Guide

#### You:
I am 29 years old. I graduated from high school but did not finish my college degree. I live in mid-missouri. Though virtually none of it makes sense to put on a resume, I have two decades of experience acting in a support role regarding consumer technology. I have a rudimentary grasp of Windows, mac, and linux administration. I would like to find a job in my geographic area in which I am able to help end users with their consumer technology which I would be realistically able to get despite my lack of college education and formal credentials. Where should I start? 

#### ChatGPT:
Starting a career in the consumer technology support field without a college degree can be challenging, but it's not impossible. Here are some steps you can take to increase your chances of finding a job in your desired field:

1. Build a Strong Resume: While your acting experience may not be directly related to technology, it can still demonstrate valuable skills such as communication, problem-solving, and customer service. Highlight these skills in your resume, along with any relevant technical skills you have acquired.

2. Expand Your Technical Knowledge: Enhance your understanding of Windows, Mac, and Linux administration by pursuing self-study. There are numerous online resources, tutorials, and video courses available that can help you improve your technical skills. Consider obtaining certifications like CompTIA A+ or Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) to validate your knowledge.

3. Gain Practical Experience: Look for opportunities to gain hands-on experience in consumer technology support. You could volunteer to help friends, family, or local organizations with their tech-related issues. Additionally, you may find entry-level positions or internships at small tech companies, repair shops, or retail stores that specialize in consumer electronics.

4. Create an Online Presence: Develop an online presence that showcases your expertise and passion for technology. Consider creating a professional LinkedIn profile and connecting with individuals in the technology industry. Share your knowledge through blog posts, YouTube videos, or social media to establish yourself as a knowledgeable resource in your field.

5. Network: Attend local tech meetups, conferences, or industry events to connect with professionals in the field. Networking can help you learn about job opportunities, gain insights into the industry, and potentially find mentors who can guide you in your career.

6. Apply for Jobs: Keep an eye on job boards, company websites, and local job fairs for positions that match your interests and skills. Look for roles such as technical support specialist, help desk technician, or customer support representative. Tailor your application materials to highlight relevant skills and experiences.

7. Emphasize Soft Skills: While technical skills are essential, employers also value soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and empathy. Emphasize these skills during interviews and provide examples of how you have effectively assisted end users in the past.

8. Be Open to Entry-Level Positions: Starting with an entry-level position can be a stepping stone to more advanced roles. Consider positions that allow you to interact directly with customers, troubleshoot issues, and provide support. This experience can help you progress in your career.

Remember, perseverance and continuous learning are key to success. With dedication, practical experience, and a strong passion for technology, you can find a job in consumer technology support that matches your goals and geographic area. Good luck!
