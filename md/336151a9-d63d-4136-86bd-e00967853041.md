# Paul Harvey's Teeth?

#### You:
How many teeth did Paul Harvey have when he passed away?

#### ChatGPT:
I'm sorry, but I don't have access to information about the number of teeth Paul Harvey had when he passed away. Paul Harvey was a well-known American radio broadcaster and commentator who passed away in 2009 at the age of 90. However, his dental health was not a matter of public record, and it is not something that I can provide information on. Is there anything else I can help you with?


#### You:
Is it possible for me to add additional teeth to my natural teeth?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, it is possible to add additional teeth to your natural teeth in certain circumstances. This can be done for various reasons, such as to replace missing teeth, to improve the appearance of your smile, or to correct dental issues.

One common method of adding additional teeth is through the use of dental implants, which are artificial tooth roots that are surgically implanted into the jawbone. A prosthetic tooth is then attached to the implant, creating a natural-looking replacement tooth.

Another option is a dental bridge, which uses a false tooth to bridge the gap created by one or more missing teeth. The bridge is anchored in place by attaching it to the adjacent natural teeth.

There are also removable options such as partial dentures that can replace multiple missing teeth.

It's important to note that adding additional teeth is a dental procedure that should be carefully considered in consultation with a qualified dental professional. They can assess your dental health and provide recommendations on the best approach to address your specific needs.
