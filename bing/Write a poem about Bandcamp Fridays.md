# Write a poem about Bandcamp Fridays.

Here is a poem I wrote about Bandcamp Fridays:

```
On the first Friday of every month
There's a special day for music lovers
When they can support their favorite artists
And discover new ones from all genres

Bandcamp Fridays are the days
When the platform waives its fees
And gives all the revenue to the creators
Who make the songs that fill our ears with glee

Whether it's rock or pop or jazz or folk
There's something for everyone to enjoy
And by buying albums or merch or tickets
We can help them keep making their art and their joy

So mark your calendars and get ready
To browse through the endless catalogues of sound
And celebrate Bandcamp Fridays with gratitude and generosity
For the music that makes our world go round.
