# How can I train my cavapoo to bark less?

Cavapoos are adorable dogs that can be trained to bark less with some patience and consistency. According to some web sources¹²³, Cavapoos may bark a lot due to stress, loneliness, anxiety, attention-seeking or alerting their owners. Some possible steps to reduce barking are:

- Identify and manage the triggers that cause your dog to bark, such as noises, visitors or other animals⁶.
- Provide your dog with enough exercise, mental stimulation and socialization⁴⁶.
- Teach your dog the "quiet" command and reward them with treats or praise when they stop barking²³⁶.
- Ignore your dog's barking when it is for attention and only give them attention when they are calm and quiet¹⁴.
- Avoid yelling at your dog or punishing them for barking as this may make them more anxious or confused¹².

You can also consult a professional trainer or a veterinarian if you need more help with your Cavapoo's barking behavior. I hope this helps! 😊
